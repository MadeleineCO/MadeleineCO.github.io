1. Mitosis = Somatic cell division
	1. Creates two genetically identical daughter cells
		1. Same number of chromosomes as parent cells
			3. Diploid = 2n
		2. Somatic cell = majority of body's cells
			1. Does not include gametes
		3. Purpose is for growth and maintenance
			1. Replaces dead cells 
			2. Differentiation and growth
	3. Interphase
		1. Prior to cell division, each chromosome is replication during interphase
		2. Identical copies = chromatids
			1. Separate prior to cell division
	4. Steps of Mitosis
		1. Prophase
			1. Single parent cell w/ duplicated DNA from interphase
			2. Chromatin condenses into chromosomes
			3. Nuclear envelope disappears
		2. Metaphase
			1. Chromosomes align at the equatorial plate
			2. Spindle fibers attach to sister chromatids
		3. Anaphase
			1. Sister chromatids separate
				1. Pulled by spindle fibers
			2. Centromeres divide
		4. Telophase
			1. Chromatin expands
			2. Nuclear envelope reforms
	5. Cytokinesis
		1. Cytoplasm divides
		2. Cell splits into two daughter cells
3. Meiosis
	1. Reduction division (diploid -> haploid)
		1. Occurs in gametes (not somatic cells)
		2. Diploid parent cell to two haploid gametic cells
			1. Daughter cells end up w/ half chromosomes as parent (haploid)
			2. Key difference between meiosis & mitosis
		3. Cell division of gametes
	2. Meiosis I
		1. Interphase occurs before meiosis I
			1. Chromosomes replicated prior to meiosis I
		2. Reduction occurs in meiosis I
		3. Random chromosome from each pair into the daughter cells
		4. Prophase I
			1. Chromosomes come together in pairs 
			2. Crossing over
		5. Metaphase I
		6. Anaphase I
		7. Telophase I
			1. Nucleus forms around each half set of chromosomes
			2. Cytokinesis follows
	3. Meiosis II
		1. Division of the two haploid cells from meiosis I to four haploid cells
		2. Like mitosis except no interphase period beforehand
		3. Male = four functional sperm cells
		4. Female = 1 functional ovum and 3 polar bodies

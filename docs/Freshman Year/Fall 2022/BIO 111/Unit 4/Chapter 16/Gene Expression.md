1. The genetic content of each somatic [[Cell]] in an [[Organism]] is the same, but not all genes are expressed in every [[Cell]]
	- The control of which genes are expressed dictates whether a [[Cell]] is an eye cell or a liver [[Cell]] or something else
		1. Eyes have all genes for liver to function but only expresses eye genes
		2. How come genes don't work the same across all cells?
		3. How do you control turning on each subset of genes to work in a coordinated way?
	- It is the differential gene expression patterns that arise in different cells that give rise to a complete [[Organism]]
	- Groups of cells w/ coordinated function = tissues and groups of tissues = organs
		1. Must be coordinated
2. When you look at controlling gene expression, there are 3 critical steps
	- Accessing the DNA
		1. If [[DNA]] is tightly bound, you can't read instructions
		2. Must read nucleotides in order
	- Transcription
		1. Must convert [[DNA]] into a mRNA
	- Translation
		1. Must convert RNA to [[Protein]]
	- Regulation can be accomplished at different levels
	- You can have proteins that body has produced but not turned on yet
		1. Caspase proteins = associated w/ apoptosis (programmed [[Cell]] death)
			- Body has already produced these in a inactivated form
				1. Called pro-caspases
			- Must be activated for apoptosis to occur
				2. Then become caspases
	- Controlling gene expression is often accomplished by controlling transcription initiation
		1. Regulatory proteins bind to DNA (This is first step - access to [[DNA]])
			- Many of these proteins are transcription factors 
				1. May block or stimulate transcription by regulating [[DNA]] access
	- Prokaryotic organisms regulate gene expression in response to their environment
		1. If you nee amino acid tyrosine to build proteins, there are two ways to get tyrosine
			- Either have it in environment or you must make it
				1. Picking it up from environment is easier (least work)
	- Eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression to maintain homeostasis in the [[Organism]]
		1. If you don't drink, you are thirsty. If it's hot, you sweat. If it's cold, you shiver. All processes meant to maintain a "steady state"
		2. Changing genes can effect homeostasis as well
3. [[Assessing DNA]]

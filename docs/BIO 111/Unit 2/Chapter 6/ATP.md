1. Adenosine Triphosphate
	1. ATP is a [[Nucleic Acid|nucleotide]]
		- Composed of ribose (5 carbon sugar), adenine, chain of 3 phosphates (phosphates are always negatively charged)
	2. Gamma phosphate group, beta phosphate group, and alpha phosphate group connected to ribose connected to adenine
		- Phosphates are held together by a bond, but phosphates are all negative so repelled away from each other and very unstable
			- Forced together, but don't want to stay together (will break apart whenever possible, thus releasing [[Energy]])
			- Potential [[Energy]] in the easily breakable phosphate bonds
			- If you break off one, you have adenosine diphosphate and break of two to get adenosine monophosphate (ADP, AMP)
2. ATP Cycle
	1. ATP hydrolysis drives exergonic reactions (releasing [[Energy]])
		- Naturally wants to occur bc phosphates don't want to be together
		- Couple reaction results in net negative delta G (exergonic and spontaneous)
	2. Cannot store ATP bc of unstable phosphate bonds
		- [[Lipid|Fats]] and [[Carbohydrate|carbs]] store better
		- [[Cell|Cells]] store only a few seconds worth of ATP
3. [[Active transport]] and ATP
	1. Uses ATP using [[Protein|proteins]] such as Na+-K+ pump ([[Active transport]])
		1. Na+-K+ pump example of energy coupling. Energy derived from exergonic ATP hydrolysis is used to pump sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane

1. Reduces organic molecules in order to generate NAD+
2. Ethanol fermentation occurs in yeast (ethanol is 2 carbon molecule)
	- CO2, ethanol, and NAD+ are produced
	- Makes 2 C ethanol instead of 2 C acetyl-CoA from 3 C pyruvate
	- Bread rises because of produced CO2 from yeast fermentation
	- Wine never gets more than 12% alcohol bc more than that amount of ethanol is toxic to yeast and ends fermentation process
3. Lactic acid fermentation (lactic acid 3 carbon molecule)
	- Occurs in animal cells (especially muscles deprived of oxygen)
		1. When we can't get enough oxygen but need to get [[Energy]], lactic acid fermentation comes in instead of aerobic respiration
		2. Our muscles store glucose in large, highly branched polysaccharides called glycogen
			- Muscles switch over to burning [[Lipid|lipids]], but less efficient.
		3. The accumulation of lactic acid makes muscles sore
	- Electrons are transferred from NADH to pyruvate to produce lactic acid
		1. Glucose --> 2 pyruvate (through glycolysis) --> 2 lactose (through fermentation)
		2. Glycolysis reduces 2 NAD+ to 2 NADH and fermentation oxidizes 2 NADH to 2 NAD+
			- Recycles NAD+ 
4. [[Cellular Respiration]]

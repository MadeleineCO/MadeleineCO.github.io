Ophisthokonta::Supergroup where the shared characteristic is the presence of single flagellum cells; Ex: sperm cell, fungi spores; Shared by Choanoflagellates, Fungi, and Animals 
^1675199388831

Heterotrophs::All animals are heterotrophs and must acquire energy from another source via eating; Herbivores = plants, Carnivores = meat, Omnivores = meat/plants, Detritivores = decomposers (ex maggots, fungi)
^1675199388846

Multicellular::Many types of cells each w/ specific functions within one organism; Function individual composed of multiple cell types; Sponge = simplest multicellular animal; Cells can communicate w/ each other to form tissues
^1675199388854

Animal cells::Lack cell walls (absence by definition, plants do have cell walls); Can have extracellular matrix (protein + glucose) and cytoskeleton to hold cells together (using a protein network)
^1675199388861

Animals must actively ---::move (ex walk/run, swim, fly); Convergent evolution (ex wings in birds, insects, and pterosaurs and streamlined body shape for swimming); Some are mostly sessile (sedentary, ex sponges, sea anemones)
^1675199388869

Animal Diversity of Form::Invertebrates are the majority of animals; Vertebrates are more derived
^1675199388877

Animal Diversity of Habitat::Marine, Freshwater, Land (Most life started in the sea then transitioned to freshwater then to land)
^1675199388884

Asexual reproduction::Binary fission mostly seen in prokaryotes, but can occur in animals; Budding seen in Cnidarians (ex coral); Parthenogenesis ("virgin beginning") is one of the few exceptions to needing a sperm + egg as females can reproduce females via just the ovum (seen in insects and a few vertebrates)
^1675199388890

Sexual reproduction::Primary form of repro in animals; Meiosis produces gametes (n) -> Male (sperm) + female (ova) fuse to form zygote (2n); Ancestral tends to be more external and derived tends to be more internal
^1675199388896

Cleavage::Series of mitotic division undergone by zygotes; As a zygote undergoes cleavage, smaller cells are created and there is no cell growth (in contrast to somatic cell division); Only seen in germ cells
^1675199388902

Gastrulation::Formation of the Archenteron (primitive gut) in zygotes; Becomes the digestive system eventually; Embryonic germ layers eventually develops into true tissues
^1675199388909

Tissues::Collections of cells that preform specialized tasks
^1675199388916

Embryonic germ layers::Ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm; Endoderm is more derived state
^1675199388922

Larval Formation::Distinct life stages that are different from the adult; Short lived (transient forms); Ex: freshwater mussels - larva are squirted onto a fish head, latch onto gills, then act as parasites; Ex: sea urchins
^1675199388929

Incomplete Metamorphosis::Insect growth stages look similar (like smaller versions of the adult); Ex: grasshopper - various stages (nymph vs adult)
^1675199388937

Complete Metamorphosis::Insect growth stages are distinct; Stages don't compete w/ each other for resources; Last stage includes development of repro maturity; Ex: caterpillar -> pupae -> butterflies; Extodices = molting 
^1675199388943

Parazoa vs Eumetazoa (phylogenic tree)::No tissues vs Specialized tissues
^1675199388964

Radiata vs Bilateria (phylogenic tree)::Radial symmetry; diploblastic vs Bilateral symmetry; Triploblastic
^1675199388970

Acoelomates (phylogenic tree)::No coelom vs Possesses body cavity
^1675199388976

Protostomia vs Deuterostomia (phylogenic tree)::Blastopore (first opening) develops into mouth vs Blastopore develops into anus
^1675199388983

Radial (body symmetry)::Cnidarians/ctenophores (ex sea anemone); Can divide like a pie around the central axis and each slice is similar; Movement is rarely directional
^1675199388990

Bilateral (body symmetry)::Most animals in this category; Anterior/Posterior; Ventral/Dorsal; Cephalization = the development of a distinct head w/ major nervous system functions (brain, vestibular system, eating, eyes, etc.); Sagittal, Traverse, and Coronal planes
^1675199388997

Sagittal plane (bilateral body symmetry)::Divides us in half vertically
^1675199389004

Traverse plane (bilateral body symmetry)::Divides us in half horizontally
^1675199389011

Coronal plane (bilateral body symmetry)::AKA Frontal; Divides us in half from the side
^1675199389018

Dorsal vs Ventral::Towards the back vs Towards the belly
^1675199389025

Cranial (Anterior) vs Caudal (Posterior)::Towards the head vs Towards the tail (feet in humans)
^1675199389031

Medial vs Proximal::Towards the middle (lateral, left side and right side) vs Towards the extremities (fingers)
^1675199389038

Reference point is very important when considering --- terms::directional
^1675199389044

Embryonic tissues::Monoblastic (single germ layer), Diploblastic (two germ layers - ecto + endo), and Triploblastic (three germ layers - ecto + meso + endo, humans); Endoderm (internal layer), Mesoderm (middle layer), Ectoderm (external layer)
^1675199389051

Organismal Hierarchy::Cell -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ System -> Organism
^1675199389058

^1675199389078

Eucoelomate::True coelomates w/ a true body cavity; Ex: humans
^1675199389085

Zygote develops into different cells through ---::determination; Each cell is determined and stays that way (ex once a muscle cell, always a muscle cell); Stem cells are before determination
^1675199389091

Porifera::Nondeterminate cells compared to determination of cells during animal zygotic growth; Seen in plants but not in animals
^1675199389097

Role of *Hox* genes (embryonic development)::AKA Homeotic genes; Each gene determines the development of a specific segments (both number and placement of appendages); More genes = increased development specializations (more specialized tissues and functions)
^1675199389104

Blastopore development (embryonic development)::If it forms into a mouth, the organism is a protostome; If it forms into anus, the organism is a deuterostome (ex humans)
^1675199389110

Cleavage patterns (embryonic development)::Could be spiral (misaligned poles; seen in protostomes) or radial (aligned poles; seen in deuterostomes and more derived)
^1675199389116

Segmentation (embryonic development)::Redundant systems (damage to just one not fatal as others can duplicate function); Improved locomotion (individual segments more semi-independent); May fuse (ex arthropods); Seen in vertebrae and muscle (evidence of segmentation in humans)
^1675199389122

Gastrovascular Cavity (GVC or sac)::Incomplete digestive system w/ one opening; Digestion and nutrient transport (both gastro and vascular); Fairly rudimentary
^1675199389129

Complete digestive system (tubular)::Alimentary canal (tube within a tube w/ two openings); In congress w/ cardiovascular system (used to transport nutrients around body); More specialized and efficient than GVC
^1675199389135

^1675378834521

Law of Superimposition::Bottom layers of strata -> older; Top layers -> younger; Geologic activity influences this
^1675378834528

A population geneticist is studying a non-native population of goldfish released into a large water hazard on a golf course. The researcher was particularly interested in their coloration patterns including dominant brown (B) and recessive gold (b), the latter of which is selectively bred into captive goldfish sold in pet stores. The geneticist randomly sampled 25 adults and found that 40 of the alleles were recessive. What is the *(recessive) allelic frequency* in this population's gene pool?::80%
^1675463584489

Reconsider the same scale color trait in the same non-native population of goldfish found in a large water hazard on a golf course. The population geneticist returns 10 years later and resamples the population to determine what (if any) change may have occurred in the population naturally. If the population is *in a state of HWE*, what must be true?::No additional individuals were released into the water hazard at any time (migration); No major mutations occurred within the gene for scale color and water quality tests confirmed the absence of any notable mutagens; The comparatively small water hazard supported a large population which fluctuated near its estimated carry capacity every year even during a particularly dry summer half-way through the study; Mating between male and female goldfish was confirmed to be random during spawning season
^1675463584497

What is true regarding genetic drift of a population?::Is associated with loss in genetic variation within the population; A significant problem for small populations but not large populations; A genetic bottleneck may form when genetic diversity continues to decrease, which makes the population less adaptable to environmental change; May observe marked  year-to-year variation in allelic frequency compared to an unaffected population.

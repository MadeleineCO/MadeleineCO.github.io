1. [[Cell Communication]]
	- Receptors can be defined by their location
	- 2 types
		1. Intracellular receptor
			- Located within the [[cell]]
			- Steroid hormones
				1. Common nonpolar, [[lipid]] soluble structure
				2. Can cross the plasma membrane to steroid receptor inside the [[cell]]
					- Plasma membrane not a barrier to hydrophobic steroid hormones 
				3. Binding of the hormone to the receptor causes the protein complex inside cell to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
					- The [[protein]] is not anchored to a membrane
					- Often binds to [[DNA]]
					- Can act as regulators of gene expression
				4. Ex: cortisol (stress hormone)
					- Cortisone is drug that helps w/ pain
					- Not given very often because they last a while (do not break down in [[water]])
				5. Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol 
					- Because these molecules are small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact with internal receptors.
					- Estradiol and testosterone
						1. Estradiol (estrogen) has hydroxyl group whereas testosterone has just oxygen instead
						2. Cholesterol has hydroxyl group there and a tail with Hs and Cs
						3. Different functional groups
							- Names give clues as to structures
							- Di = two hydroxyl groups
							- Testosterone and cortisone have oxygen where cholesterol and estradiol have hydroxyl group
			- Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm. 
				1. Many intracellular receptors are *transcription factors* that interact with [[DNA]] in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
				2. Can turn genes on and off
		2. Intercellular receptor
			- [[Cell]] surface receptor or membrane receptors located on the plasma membrane to bind a ligand outside the cell
				1. Transmembrane proteins in contact w/ both the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment
					- Beta sheet makes channel through phospholipid bilayer
					- Has tertiary structure on outside of channel where ligand can bind
			- Photons can be signal for plants 
				1. Stimulating signal
			- Sound waves can be signal for hearing
				1. Ear has transmembrane proteins
				2. Sound waves can physically push receptors and stimulate them
					- Receptors specific to different wavelengths
					- Neurons inside brain are sensitive to defined wavelengths
	- Subclasses of membrane receptors
		1. Chemically gated ion channels 
			- Channel-linked receptors that open to let specific ion pass in response to a ligand
			- Sodium is higher outside of [[cell]]
				1. Can open channel that allows sodium to enter
				2. Resting potential is the charge inside the [[cell]]
					- Common value is -60 mV
					- Naturally negative
					- When sodium enters, resting potential increases (less negative)
						1. Could eventually become positive
						2. Can depolarizing the [[cell]] towards zero and then can hyperpolarize in the opposite direction
						3. Called action potential
							- How nerves work
							- Neuron fires, influx of sodium, becomes less negative/more positive
							- After firing, the Na+K+ pump must pump ions out
				3. If sodium gate broken, paralysis occurs
		2. Enzymatic receptors
			- Receptor is an enzyme that is activated by the ligand
				1. Almost all are [[protein]] kinases
		3. G [[protein]]-coupled receptor (GCPR)
			- A G-[[protein]] (bound to GTP) assists in transmitting the signal from receptor to enzyme (effector)
			- G-[[protein]] = protein bound to GTP
				1. Guanine triphosphate (another nucleotide)
			- G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) = receptors bound to G-proteins
				1. G-protein is a switch turned on by the receptor
				2. Hydrolyzing a phosphate turns off receptor
					- Cutting phosphate off of GTP (makes GDP)
					- G-proteins have the intrinsic ability to hydrolyze 
						1. Can turn itself off after receptor turns it on
				3. G-[[protein]] then activates effector proteins (usually [[enzymes]])
				4. Single largest category of receptor type in animal cells is GPCRs
					- A worm has exactly 958 cells and >5% of proteins are GPCRs in these worms
					- Critical for animal cells
				5. G-protein provides link between receptor that receives signal and effector [[protein]] that produces cellular response

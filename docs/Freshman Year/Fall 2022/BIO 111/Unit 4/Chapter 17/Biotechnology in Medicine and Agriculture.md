1. Medically important proteins can be produced in bacteria
	- A normal liver and a cancerous liver both produce mRNAs
		1. But cancerous liver not producing same mRNAs
		2. Or both livers are producing same mRNAs but cancerous liver is producing different proportions (different amounts)
			- In cancer cells, an mRNA may be produced in too low amounts, not at all, or in too high amounts
		3. cDNA can be used as mechanism to understand disease
	- Human insulin
		1. Protein that is necessary to bind to receptor to allow glucose transporter to bring glucose past membrane into the cell
		2. We used to take insulin from pig blood to give to diabetics
			- Once we figured out genetic code for insulin, we can transform bacteria to produce human insulin
				1. Then we let bacteria produce the protein
				2. More efficient and can scale up production of insulin
	- Interferon
		1. Used in fighting cancer
		2. Can identify and target cancer cells
		3. Chemotherapy is putting poison in body that kills cancer cells
			- Chemical also makes you sick bc binds to non cancerous cells
		4. Interferon is natural chemical that is produced in body
			- If you scale up production, another method to fight cancer
	- Atrial peptides
		1. If you have damage in heart muscle, portions may not contract properly
			- Could build up scar tissue
			- If you heal scar tissue, you may be able to help contractions
	- Tissue plasminogen activator
	- Human growth hormone
		1. Pituitary gland
			- Like master gland
			- Secretes small amounts of growth hormone
			- If you have normal amounts, you reach proper size
				1. If you don't have enough, too small. If you have too much, too big.
				2. Hormones have long-lasting effects
	- Problem has been purification of desired proteins from other bacterial proteins
		1. All of these vital proteins were very complicated to purify
		2. If you can grow them in bacteria, its easier to purify the protein
		3. Much easier to purify insulin from bacteria flask then from pig blood
2. Vaccines
	- Some last whole life whereas others last shorter lengths
	- Subunit vaccines (fragment of inactivated virus)
		1. Genes encoding a part of the protein coat are spliced into a fragment of the vaccinia (cowpox) genome
		2. Injection of harmless recombinant virus leads to immunity
			- Immunity from antibodies that are specifically created in response to virus
	- DNA vaccines
		1. Depend on the cellular immune response (not antibodies)
	- mRNA vaccines
		1. mRNA is encapsulated in lipid capsule 
		2. Complications may arise from what its packaged in
			- We are still developing these
3. Gene therapy
	- Can take virus and manipulate it to contain normal hemoglobin gene
		1. Can insert in cells of person w/ sickle cell anemia so body starts producing normal cells
	- Gene therapy adds a functional copy of a gene to correct a hereditary disorder
	- Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) illustrates both the potential and the problems
		1. On positive side, 15 children have been treated successfully and are still alive
		2. On negative side, three other children treated have developed leukemia due to therapy
4. Transgenics
	- Transgenic animals
		1. Contain recombinant DNA
		2. Used to expressed human genes
		3. Examples - mice, sheep, goats
		4. Baby fae
			- A baby w/ a baboon heart (trying to keep her alive until another heart bc available)
			- A need for organs
		5. Mouse that grows cartilage for ear replacement?
		6. Run into bioethical questions
			- Appropriate care for animals
			- Animal research is regulated
				1. Concerns about pain or suffering about mouse, bird, sheep, etc.
			- How do we do these things in humane and consciences way
	- Transgenic plants
		1. Also called genetically modified organism (GMO)
		2. Incorporates genes resistant to disease, herbicides, and/or pesticides
		3. Bt toxin
			- A bacterial toxin that keeps pests from eating the plant
			- Bt toxin gene introduced into plants
			- Safe for the environment and non-toxic to humans and other mammals
			- Approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide
			- Plants produce metabolites in response to environments
				1. Tobacco plants produce nicotine as response to bugs eating it
		1. Flavr Savr Tomato
			- GM crop
			- Slows down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections
			- Want to allow time for transport and retail so it lasts for consumer
		2. A wild strawberry is very small
			- Our strawberries are much bigger
			- Polyploidy = multiple sets of chromosomes
				1. Often makes plants bigger
4. Predicting disease risk at the individual level
	- BRCA1
		1. 70% of women that express BRCA1 at mRNA level develop breast cancer
			- Early indication that breast cancer may be developing
		2. Precedes mammogram detection 
			- Expressed far before tumor is found
	- The earlier you can detect cancer, the greater the chances of recovery and prevention
	- Changes in transcription will precede translation (production of proteins)
		1. Changes in transcription represent a cell's earliest response to the development of a disease
		2. Changes in transcription will precede translation (production of proteins)
		3. PCA3 and BRCA 1 are examples of molecular markers of disease
			- They are at level of transcription whereas mammograms and PSA test come later
	- PCA3
		1. A gene that is expressed in prostate epithelial cells and overexpressed in cancerous cells
		2. The PCA3 test is considered to be a better indicator of cancer than the more well known PSA test, which measures the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in the blood

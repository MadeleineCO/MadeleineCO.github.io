1. Membrane structure
	1. Made of phospholipids arranged in bilayer 
	2. Globular [[Protein]] inserted in [[Lipid]] bilayer
	3. Fluid mosaic model: mosaic of [[Protein|proteins]] floats in or on the fluid lipid bilayer like boats on a pond
		1. [[Protein|proteins]] like ping pong balls in bathtub 
		2. Tennis ball is globular [[Protein]]
		3. Can restrict movement w/ tight junctions
		4. Not rigid
2. Phospholipid bilayer ([[Lipid]]) 
	1. Structure consists of Glycerol (3 Carbon polyalcohol)
	2. 2 fatty acids attached to glycerol
		- Nonpolar and hydrophobic
		- Charged phosphate is hydrophilic
		- Phospholipids cluster with hydrophobic tails
		- Attached to phosphate is amino acid 
			- Serine is amino acid
	3. Flexible matrix and a barrier to permeability
3. Transmembrane [[Protein|proteins]]
	1. Integral membrane [[Protein|proteins]]
	4. Trans [[Protein|proteins]] work across the membrane
	5. Can be made up of beta sheet [[Protein|proteins]] for tunnels or alpha helix proteins with a part inside and a part outside
4. Interior [[Protein]] network
	1. Peripheral membrane [[Protein|proteins]]
	2. Only work on inside of membrane
5. [[Cell]] surface markers
	1. Glycoproteins and glycolipids
		1. Sugar ([[Carbohydrate]]) + [[Protein]] or [[Lipid]]
		2. [[Cell]] surface markers
		3. Bacterial [[Cell|cells]] have different surface markers
			- How body recognizes foreign substances
		4. Transplant patients must have identical [[Cell]] surface markers for success
6. In [[Eukaryotic Cell]], plasma membrane make cells more or less rigid
	1. Regulated by cholesterol
	2. Cholesterol is hydrophobic
		- More cholesterol = more rigid and vise versa
		- Animal [[Cell|cells]] have cholesterol but plant [[Cell|cells]] do not
			- [[Animal Cells vs Plant Cells]]
		- Cholesterol has only C and H
			- Makes it nonpolar and very hydrophobic
		- Can be converted into hormones
			- Testosterone and estrogen
			- Removes hydrophobic tail
			- Same ring structure, but two different structures
				1. Estrogen must be converted from testosterone
		- Can't diffuse through membrane
			- How does it get inside [[Cell]]?
			- Transport [[Protein]]
				1. Two of them
				2. LDL - low density lipoprotein
					1. Can bring it inside [[Cell]]
					2. LDL tends to build up in bloodstream (bad)
				3. HDL -  high density lipoprotein
					1. Also transport [[Protein]]
		- Glycolipid
			- Can be embedded in membrane cause of hydrocarbon tails
7. [[Membrane proteins]]
8. Transportation into [[Cell|cells]]
	1. [[Passive transport]]
	2. [[Active transport]]

1. Photosynthesis
	- Photo = "light" and synthesis "to synthesize"
	- Light dependent reaction
		1. Light --> charged energy
		2. Carbon fixation that involves the Calvin cycle
	- Light independent reaction
		1. Charged energy --> energy that can be used for plant cells
	- Energy "capture" preformed by autotrophs only
		1. Plants and algae 
		2. Take sunlight energy and converts low energy organic molecules into high energy organic molecules
			- CO2 --> Glucose (C6H12O6)
			- Also requires water (H2O) to donate electrons
		3. O2 is a by-product
			- Comes from the splitting of water
	- 6CO2 + 6H2O + Sunlight --> C6H12O6 + 6O2
		1. LI + LD + LD --> LI + LD
		2. Water, sunlight, and oxygen are part of light dependent reaction
		3. Carbon dioxide and glucose are part of the light independent reaction
	- Glucose can then be converted into other (larger) organic compounds 
		1. Ex: fructose, starch, cellulose, fatty acids, etc.)
2. Don't forget about Aerobic Respiration!
	- C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6H2O + 6CO2 + 36ATP
		1. Opposite of photosynthesis
		2. Products are reactants and vise versa
		3. All living things do aerobic respiration but only autotrophs do photosynthesis
	- Carbon cycle
		1. Plants take our waste CO2 and we eat plants (or other things that eat plants) to get glucose (w/ carbons) for energy
3. Our Experiments
	- How does sunlight energy capture occur?
		1. Photosynthetic pigments in plants
		2. Chloroplasts
	- Sunlight is made up of a spectrum of wavelengths
		1. White sunlight has range of wavelengths from about 400-800 nm
			- Visible spectrum
		2. Pigments absorb different wavelengths 
			- Plants w/ variety of pigments can absorb more wavelengths
	- How can we measure photosynthesis?
		1. The release of oxygen (O2)
	- What happens to photosynthesis if we remove sunlight?
		1. Doesn't occur

1. [[Cellular Structures]]
	1. Possess a membrane-bound nucleus
	2. More complex than prokaryotic [[Cell|cells]]
	3. Compartmentalize many cellular functions within organelles and the endomembrane system
		- [[DNA]] never leaves nucleus, but RNA does ([[Nucleic Acid]])
	4. Possess a cytoskeleton for support and to maintain [[Cell Structure|cellular structure]]
		- Gives [[Organism]] its form
	5. Budding yeast is the simplest eukaryotic organism
		- One of smallest genomes
		- Can easily see the membrane-wrapped organelles
	6. Can possess different levels of complexity
		- Can me uni or multi cellular
	7. Plants and animals are both eukaryotes
		- Plants have a [[cell]] wall (made from polysaccarides)
			- Animals do not have cell wall
		 - Plants have chloroplasts for photosynthesis
			 - Animals do not
		- Both plants and animals have membrane bound nucleus, plasma membrane
2. Plasma membrane
	1. Levels of fluidity differ
	2. Different [[protein|proteins]]
		1. Not exclusively phospholipids
			- Have three of four macromolecules 
				- [[Protein|proteins]], [[lipid|lipids]], and [[carbohydrate|carbs]]
				- Not [[nucleic acid]]
3. Study distinctive characteristics between eukaryotic cells and [[Prokaryotic Cell]]
4. Nucleus
	1. Endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus (where ribosomal RNA is made), chromatin ([[DNA]] that interacts w/ proteins), nucleoplasm, nuclear pore, nuclear envelope
	2. RNA can go out but DNA cannot
5. Ribosomes
	1. Made up of large subunit and small subunit
	2. Site of protein synthesis (assembles amino acids into proteins)
	3. Composed of ribosomal RNA and proteins
	4. Found within the cytosol of the cytoplasm
6. Mitochondria
	1. Powerhouse of the cell
	2. Where energy is made or converted from one form to another
		- Like the engine in the car
	3. Has lots of membrane
		- Inner membrane
		- Outer membrane
	4. Fairly large organelle
		- About the size of bacteria
	5. Present in all types of eukaryotes
		- Not in prokaryotes
			- [[Prokaryotic cell]] generates energy in plasma membrane
	1. Contains oxidative metabolism enzymes for transferring the energy within macromolecules to atp
7. Peroxisomes
	1. Breaks down fatty acids and amino acids
	2. Detoxifies poisons (including alcohol)
		- Eating antioxidants helps these organelles
	3. Safely breaks down the H2O into oxygen and [[water]]
	4. Glyoximes, specialized peroxisomes in plants are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars
8. Vesicles and Vacuoles
	1. Function and storage and transport
	2. Vacuoles are larger than vesicles
	3. Vesicles can move, whereas vacuoles are generally stationary
		- Vacuoles are like storage reservoir
		- Vesicles are more like package (easily delivered)

9. [[Animal Cells vs Plant Cells]]
10. [[The Endomembrane System and Proteins]]
11. Cytoskeleton
	1. Three types
		1. Actin filaments
			1. Smallest cytoskeletal component
			2. Just inside of plasma membrane
				1. Called the cortex
			3. Gives cell its shape
		2. Microtubules
			- Largest cytoskeletal component
			- Railways
		- Intermediate filaments
			- Medium-sized
			- Cluster around nucleus but can be found throughout [[cell]]
12. Extracellular matrix (ECM)
	1. Outside of cell
	2. Proteins that are made and put on outside
		1. Transferred from ribosome through exocytosis
	3. Sugars on outside as well
	4. Collagen 
		1. Fibrous [[protein]] that composes glycoproteins
	5. Integrin
		1. [[Protein|Proteins]] present in plasma membrane
		2. May be connected to the cytoplasm
		3. Anchors proteins on outside of [[cell]]
13. Intercellular junctions
	1. Plasmodesmata
		- Channels that pass between [[cell]] walls of adjacent plant cells
	2. Cells of particular tissues adhere in unique ways
		- Don't adhere with other organs
	3. Cadherin
		- Bind like [[cell|cells]]
	4. Tight junctions
		- Watertight seal between two adjacent tissues
		- Don't allow liquid to pass
		- Protect [[cell|cells]] from stomach acid ([[Acids and bases]])
	5. Gap junctions
		- Channels for adjacent cells in animal [[cell|cells]]
	6. Desmosomes
		- Maintains the [[cell|cells]] in sheet like formation

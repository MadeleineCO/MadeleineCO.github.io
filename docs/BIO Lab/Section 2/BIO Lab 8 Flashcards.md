DNA::Deoxyribose nucleic acid; made up of nucleotides (monomers of nucleic acid)
^1666798662012

Chromatid (biol)::Complex of DNA inside the nucleus; uncondensed (DNA spends most of its time in this form)
^1666798662025

Chromosome::Condensed and organized chromatin
^1666798662034

Chromatid::Arm of the chromosome
^1666798692416

Gene (biol)::Portion of DNA that codes for a trait (which is expressed as a protein); Instructions to build a particular protein; Genes lead to traits
^1666798692423

Allele::Alternative forms of genes; Genes exist in various forms w/ different varieties (ex brown eye vs blue eye)
^1666798662046

Haploid::When a cell has one copy of each chromosome; Our human haploid num is 23; Gamete cells
^1666798662057

Diploid::When a cell has two copies of each chromosome; Humans have 23 pairs or 46 total chromosomes in the majority of our cells
^1666798662067

Homozygous (biol)::When alleles for a trait are identical; One set from mother and one set from father so two copies of every chromosome; If set from mother and father the same, homozygous
^1666798709352

Heterozygous (biol)::When alleles for a trait are not identical; Set from mother and set from father are different
^1666798709360

Mitosis (asexual reproduction)::Main function is maintenance and growth; We all started life as single zygote that divided through mitosis and grew; Replaces dead cells
^1666798662079

Cloning (biol)::No genetic diversity; Occurs in somatic cells through mitosis
^1666798726362

Mitosis allows a single cell to split into ---::two genetically identical cells; Diploid (2n) to diploid (2n)
^1666798662088

Cell cycle::Interphase --> prophase --> metaphase --> anaphase --> telophase
^1666798662094

Interphase::Chromatid dispersed throughout nucleus; Majority of a cell's life is spent in interphase
^1666798662102

Prophase::DNA begins to condense and organizes into chromosomes; Centrioles form; Nuclear envelope dissolves 
^1666798662110

Metaphase::Chromosomes line up along the metaphase plate (like equator)
^1666798662117

Anaphase::Chromosomes pulled apart; Move towards opposite poles
^1666798662126

Telophase::Nuclear envelope reforms
^1666798662134

Cytokinesis (biol)::Division into two separate cells after mitosis
^1666798726371

Unchecked mitotic growth leads to ---::cancer
^1666798662142

We observed mitosis in ---::an onion root tip (roots must elongate and grow through mitosis) and in white fish blastula
^1666798662151

Meiosis (sexual reproduction)::Formation of gametes (sperm and eggs); Occurs in germ cells; Involves two divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II)
^1666798662157

Meiosis allows a single cell to split into ---::four genetically unique daughter cells
^1666798662164

Meiosis I::Interphase I --> prophase I --> metaphase I --> anaphase I --> telophase I
^1666798662172

Reduction division::When chromosome number is divided; Occurs via meiosis
^1666798662179

Genetic diversity::Introduced during crossing over in prophase I and independent assortment during metaphase I; Also random gamete "selection"
^1666798662186

Meiosis II::Similar to mitosis and results in four final haploid cells
^1666798662194

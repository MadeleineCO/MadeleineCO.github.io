1. This form of transportation requires energy to move substances across [[Plasma Membranes]]
	1. ATP is used directly or indirectly to fuel active transport
		- ATP is a [[Nucleic Acid|nucleotide]] (adenosine triphosphate)
2. Moves substances from low to high concentration against the concentration gradient
	1. Outside [[Cell]] is lots of Na+ and inside is lots of K+
		- Diffusion would want sodium to move inside the cell, but animal cells want to keep sodium level low inside cell
		- Net charge is positive outside cell cause positive sodium ions, but net charge is negative inside
			- Called the electrochemical gradient 
3. Requires the use of highly selective carrier [[Protein|proteins]]
	1. Uniporters: move one molecule at a time
	2. Symporters: moves two molecules in same direction
	3. Antiporters: moves two molecules in opposite directions
	4. These terms can also be used to describe facilitated diffusion carriers during passive transport
	5. Sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) pump (carrier [[Protein]])
		- Requires energy to function!
			- Direct use of ATP
		- Most common transporter in [[Cell|cells]]
		- Ions cannot go across [[Plasma Membranes]] on their own through [[Passive transport]]
		- Both Na+ and K+ are positively charged, so going against charges (electrochemical gradient) in both directions
			- Also going against concentration gradient for both ions
		- Uses an antiporter to move 3 Na+ out of the cell and 2 K+ into the cell
			- 3 sodium for every two potassium ions
		- ATP energy is used to change the conformation of the carrier protein
			- Function is altered when you change structure
			- Breaks one of the phosphates in ATP and put the phosphate group on the pump
				1. Gets phosphorylated or dephosphorylated
					1. Adds or removes phosphate from ATP
				- Changes tertiary structure
					1. Allows it to bind or eject ions
					2. When you cleave a phosphate, you get ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to change [[Protein]] shape to release K+ to inside. Then releases phosphate to move Na+ to outside. 
		- Affinity of the carrier protein for either Na+ or K+ changes so the  ions can be carried across the membrane
1. Coupled transport
	1. Uses ATP indirectly 
		- Uses energy released when molecule moves by diffusion to supply energy to active transport of different molecule
	2. Symporter is used
		- Glucose-Na+ symporter captures the energy from Na+ diffusion to move glucose against a concentration gradient
			- Na+ naturally wants to go into [[Cell]]
			- Glucose binds to sodium and tags along into the cell
		- The symporter is a membrane bound [[Protein]]
			- Changes tertiary structure when glucose and sodium are bound and when they are not bound
	3. Binds one glucose and two sodium. Sodium wants to go in and symporter allows it to enter, thus also allowing glucose to enter. 
		- Causes Na+ concentration to go up in cell, so the sodium-potassium pump must release the extra sodium
2. Bulk transport
	1. Endocytosis
		- Movement of large quantities of substances into [[Cell]]
	2. Phagocytosis: cell engulfs substance
		- Like white blood cell engulfing bacteria
		- Cell membrane surrounds particle, engulfs it, and creates a vesicle with substance inside. Like bubble inside [[Cell]]. Fuses to lysosome to digest what's inside.
	3. Pinocytosis: cell takes in only fluid
		- Forms a vesicle around fluid. Like bubble.
	4. Receptor-mediated endocytosis: specific molecules are takin in after they bind to a receptor
		- Viruses trick receptors and are taken in this way
		- Forms [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] vesicle (bubble) around targeted substances 
		- How cholesterol enters the [[Cell]]
			- Binds to HDL or LDL on outside of cell
	5. Exocytosis 
		- Vesicles (bubbles) fuse to [[Plasma Membranes|plasma membrane]] then release substances to outside of [[Cell]]

1. Mendel's Laws
	1. Gregor Mendel
		1. Investigated inheritance at the organism level (1860s)
		2. Concluded that plants transmit distinct factors to offspring
		3. Based on his studies,  he formulated his laws
	2. Law of Segregation
		1. Each individual has two factors for each trait
			2. The factors segregate during the formation of gametes
			3. Each gamete contains only one factor from each pair of factors
			4. Fertilization gives each new individual two factors for each trait
		2. Today, we know that genes determine characteristics of an organism
			1. Genes are found on chromosomes
			2. Chromosomes that are homologous are members of a pair and carry genes for the same traits in the same order
			3. Alleles are alternate forms of a gene for the same trait
			4. Alleles are always at the same locus (location) on each chromosome of a homologous pair 
		3. The inheritance of a single trait
			1. Phenotype = physical appearance of an individual w/ regard to a trait
			2. Genotype = alleles responsible for a given trait
				1. Two alleles for a trait
				2. A capital letter symbolizes a dominant allele (W)
				3. A lower-case letter symbolizes a recessive allele (w)
				4. Dominant refers to the allele that will mask the expression of the alternate (recessive) allele
		4. One-Trait Cross
			1. Ex: Two individuals who are both Ww
				1. A Punnett Square can be used to solve this problem
				2. Cross of hetero parents = 1:2:1 genotypic ratio or 3:1 phenotypic ratio
			2. One-Trait Crosses and Probability
				1. The chance of two or more independent events occurring together is the product of their chances of occurring separately
				2. Ex: In the cross Ww X Ww, what is the chance of obtaining either a W or a w from a parent?
					1. Chance of W = 1/2 and chance of w = 1/2
					2. Therefore the probability of having these genotypes is. . .
						1. WW = 1/4
						2. Ww + wW = 1/2
						3. ww = 1/4
		5. Breeders of plants and animals may do a *test cross* to determine the likely genotype of an individual w/ the dominant phenotype
			1. Cross w/ a recessive individual (bc known genotype)
			2. If there are any offspring w/ the recessive phenotype, then the dominant parent must be hetero
				1. Genotypic Ratio = 1 hetero : 1 homo rec if parent A is hetero and parent B is homo rec
	3. Law of independent assortment
		1. The alleles of two (or more) different genes get sorted into gametes independently of one another
			1. Each pair of factors assorts independently without regard to how the others separate
			2. All possible combinations of factors can occur in gametes
		2. During meiosis ([[Mitosis & Meiosis]]), homologous chromosomes separate so there is only one member of each pair in a gamete
			1. There is only one allele for each trait (such as hairline) in each gamete
			2. No two letters in a gamete can be the same letter of the alphabet
				1. If genotype is Ww, then gametes from this individual will contain either W or w
		3. Two-Trait Crosses (Dihybrid Crosses)
			1. Ex: WwSs x WwSs
				1. W = widow's peak (dominant)
				2. w = straight hairline (recessive)
				3. S = short fingers (dominant)
				4. s = long fingers (recessive)
				5. Four possible gametes each
					1. WS, Ws, wS, ws
				6. Phenotypic ration of possible offspring
					1. 9 dom dom
						1. Widow's peak, short fingers
					2. 3 dom rec
						1. Widow's peak, long fingers
					3. 3 rec dom
						1. Straight hairline, short fingers
					4. 1 rec rec
						1. Straight hairline, long fingers
				7. Probability Laws
					1. Probability of widow's peak = 3/4
					2. Probability of short fingers = 3/4
					3. Probability of straight hairline = 1/4
					4. Probability of long fingers = 1/4
				8. Using the Product Rule
					1. Probability of widow's peak and short fingers = 3/4 x 3/4 = 9/16
					2. Probability of widow's peak and long fingers = 3/4 x 1/4 = 3/16
					3. Probability of straight hairline and short fingers = 1/4 x 3/4 = 3/16
					4. Probability of straight hairline and long fingers = 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16

1. [[Roughages]]: Plant components (stems/leaves); High in fiber, not nutrients
2. [[Concentrates]]: High in energy and protein; Seeds and grains from plants and animal by-products
3. Food additives
	1. {[[Animal Nutrition|Nutrient]] additives
		- Additives/Availability of [[Nutrition - Vitamins|vitamins]] and [[Nutrition - Minerals|minerals]]
		- Ex: salt block
			- White salt blocks are pure sodium chloride
			- Brown salt blocks contain NaCl and macro/micro minerals
				1. Salt is a great intake limiter (regulates intake of minerals)
	1. Non-nutrient additives
		- Not [[Animal Nutrition|nutrients]] but somehow influences digestion/metabolism ([[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]])
		- Selective antibiotic we feed to [[ruminant|ruminants]] (killing off less efficient microbes)
			- Ex: Ionophore
			- If you feed Monessen to [[Cattle (Bovine)]], you will see an increase in feed efficiency and avg daily gain
				1. More weight gain
				2. Increases efficiency of pounds of feed per pounds of gain
				3. Space limitations inside rumen and microbes all competing for resources
					1. Producing VFA's as by-product
					2. Some microbes produce more efficient VFA's than others
					3. We can selectively kill the less efficient microbes to gain more efficient microbes
				4. Resistance can become a problem
		- Adding "beneficial" or efficient organisms 
			- Ex: yeast cultures
				- Feed yeast to try and establish them in the rumen and the cecum
				- Can help [[Horse (Equine)|horse's]] cecum
				- Problems = may not be competitive enough as the most competitive microbes are probable thy most well-established
4. Processing 
	1. Mixing forages/concentrates/additives
	2. Problems w/ proportional mixes of grains ([[Concentrates]])
		- Nutritional value can fluctuate bc of wide variation in nutritional value
			- Ex: oat quality can vary widely
			- Based on fractional percentages, not quality
	3. Processing feeds
		- Grind seed --> extrudes in pellets
		- Creates better consistency and increasing digestibility
		- Adding [[Nutrition - Vitamins|vitamins]] and [[Nutrition - Minerals|minerals]] is much easier
		- Much more common than proportional mixes

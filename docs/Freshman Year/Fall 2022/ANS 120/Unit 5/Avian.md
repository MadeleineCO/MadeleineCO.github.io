1. [[Domestication]]
	1. Relatively recently domesticated
		- Chickens
			- Broiler = meat
	2. Turkeys
		- Few species from North America
		- The domesticated turkey can no longer breed
			- Bred for white breast meat
			- Males are too big to physically breed
			- Bred ability to fly out
2. [[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]]
	1. [[Avian]]/Modified [[Monogastric]]
		- Carnivore
		- Omnivore
		- Granivore
		- Frugivore
		- Insectivore
		- Minor differences between different birds and diets
	2. Mouth/Beak = Prehension
		- NO mastication
	3. Crop = mild chemical digestion and moistens ingested material
		- Pouch located outside the body
		- No strong acids/bases
	4. Proventriculus = the abomasum 
		- Gastric stomach
		- Chemical digestion
	5. Gizzard
		- Mastication (mechanical digestion)
		- Very thick pouch; strong muscles
			- Smashes the ingested material
		- Birds eat small rocks (grit) to get minerals and to help pulverize food in the gizzard
			- Grit increases surface area grinding food + minerals
	6. Small intestines
		- Proximal = chemical digestion/absorption
		- Distal = absorption 
	7. Ceca
		- 2 ceca whereas most animals have one cecum
		- NOT for microbial digestion
		- Place for mixing and short term storage of urine and feces
			- Birds don't have a bladder
			- Made up of smooth muscle that can spontaneously contract for defecation 
				1. Comes out the cloaca ("common opening")
					1. Reproductive component comes out that way as well
	8. Large intestine
		- Water metabolism
	9. Cloaca = common opening for waste and repro
3. Avian Breeds
	-  Domesticated --- yrs ago ([[Domestication]])
	- Primary chicken breeds
		1. Egg laying breeds
			- White leghorn
			- Frizzles - have upturned feathers
			- Ayam Cemani - produce 10x more melanin than normal (very black); Predominantly found in Malasia
		1. Meat breeds
			- Broiler - number one farm commodity in ga
			- Silkie - Japanese bread w/ black meat and silky feathers
	- Turkey breeds
		1. Bronze, White, Bourbon, Narragan
		2. Bred to be so large that we must reproduce by AI
	- Geese breeds
		1. Mostly out of Africa
		2. Brown and White Chinese
		3. Feathers, meat, and eggs
	- Duck breeds
		1. Perkin
		2. Orrington
		3. Muscovy
		4. Feathers, meat, and eggs
	- We also raise undomesticated birds
		1. Ratites
			- Ostriches and Emus
			- They don't have middle breast bone bc they don't fly
			- Produce large eggs
			- Mostly for production of other components such as leather, ostrich meat (red meat)
	- Quail hunting
4. [[Poultry]]
5. Female Avian Reproduction
	- Ovary
		1. ---
	- Magnum = where albumin is added
		1. Albumin is primary protein
		2. Chalazae = holds yoke in the egg
			- Made up of albumin
		3. Thick and thin
			- Degree of hydration
		4. ---
	- Isthmus
		1. Adds inner and outer shell membrane
	- Uterus
		1. Forms the shell membrane
		2. Calcium carbonate and other strong polar salts
		3. Shell color depends on pigment producing cells in the lining of the shell gland
	- Vagina
		1. ---
	- Cloaca
	- The whole process takes about 25-27 hours from ovulation to oviposition
	- Egg ends up with. . .
		1. A growing yoke
			- Has bands of color from when bird is eating and when they aren't
			- Baby starts at top of yoke and grows down
			- Use albumin and yoke sac for nutrients
				 1. Birds can use yoke sac for nutrients a couple days after hatching
		1. ---
	- Induced ovulation
		1. Only ovulate at certain times of day (between 6am to 2pm)
			- Photo period influenced
		2. Generally lay 3-5 eggs in one day then skip a couple days before laying again
	- Ground nesting birds
		1. When they hatch, they are very wet but thirty minutes later they are fluffy and cute
		2. Lay a clutch of 8-10 eggs
			- 19-20 day incubation
			- All hatch within 12 hr period
				1. But oviposition may have occurred days apart (birds only lay 3-5 eggs in one day)
				2. Better to avoid predication
				3. There is an embryonic communication network
					- Beaks vibrate
					- Slow vibration felt in contact with another (telling bird to grow more quickly)
						1. Slow clicks increases neighbors development rate
						2. Fast vibration = please develop more slowly
							- Decrease neighbors development rate
					- Net effect is averaging out the time required for incubation
		1. Tree nesting birds are different
			- Must less developed
			- 21 days after hatching, they are just starting to fledge
			- Dependent on parents for much longer than ground nesting birds
			- Do not have embryonic communication network
				1. Hatch at different times
				2. Bigger chicks tend to have greatest chance of survival
			- Smaller clutches
6. Male Reproductive system
	- Two Testis
		1. Inside body cavity
		2. Low sperm production
			- However, sperm can survive in chickens for over a month
				1. Turkey sperm can survive for 70 days in female track
	- Modified epididymis
	- ---
7. Avian flu
	- H5N1 Bird Flu Virus in US
		1. Wild birds = 3124
		2. States w/ wild bird flu = 46
		3. [[Poultry]] affected = 47780088
		4. States w/ [[Poultry]] outbreaks = ---
		5. Has only jumped to one human so not a big zoonatic risk
8. Urban Chickens
	- Becoming more popular for fun
	- CDC
		1. Outbreaks of Salmonella have been reported from 49 states from backyard [[Poultry]]
		2. CDC Recommendation = stop kissing chickens and don't let them live in your house
		3. ---

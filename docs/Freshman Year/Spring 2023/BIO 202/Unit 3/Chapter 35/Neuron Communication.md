1. Electrochemical gradients
	1. Animal cells like to be surrounded in isotonic solutions
		1. Isotonic = same concentration of solute to water in extracellular fluid as the cell itself
		2. Semipermeable cell membranes have distinct disparities between inside and outside
			1. Called the electrochemical gradient
				1. A concentration difference (if nothing stopping the solute, it will move along its concertation difference)
				2. Ions also have electrical (charge) differences
					3. Ions can also move based on their electrical gradients
				3. Usually, cell is very negative inside so positive ions want to travel inside
					1. Depolarization = when cell becomes less negative as positive ions enter 
					2. We have potassium channels and sodium channels that are voltage gated
						1. Must reach certain change level before it can open completely, allowing ions to move into or out of the cell 
				4. Proteins generally are impermeable to membranes (too large)
					1. Generally have a wholistic negative charge
				5. Usually think of this as inside of cell relative to outside of cell 
		3. ---
2. Resting Potential 
	1. Resting Potential = Neuron in its resting, unstimulated state
	2. Usually, the resting potential of a cell is -70mV
		1. This is linked w/ K+ permeability
		2.  Movement of positive ions inside or outside the cell can change this
	3. Maintaining resting potential relies upon two structures:
		1. Na+K+ Pump
			1. Pumps 3 NA+ out and 2 K+ in
			2. Requires ATP to function
		2. Voltage-Gated Ion Channels
			1. K+ more common than Na+ channels
				1. More permeable to K+
			2. Allows ions to travel according to concertation gradient when open
			3. K+ normally "leaks out"
				1. Like a leaky faucet 
		3. Chemical gradient
			1. K+ (generally) passively diffuses out of the cell
		4. Electrical gradient
			1. K+ must be actively transported into the cell
				1. Requires energy
		5. --- insert graphic
3. Changes in Membrane Potential
	1. Equilibrium potential
		1. Resting potential
		2. Under normal circumstances
	2. Depolarize
		1. When the cell becomes less negative
		2. As more Na+ ions enter the cell, depolarization occurs 
		3. Polar = one side is positive, one side is negative
	3. Repolarize
		1. When the cell becomes more negative
		2. Pumping potassium ions inside the cell repolarizes it 
	4. Hyperpolarize
		1. When the cell is made more negative than the resting potential (-70mv)
		2. The small amount of time that cell is hyperpolarized, it cannot be stimulated again
			1. 1 millisecond long
		3. Sodium-potassium pump is important for getting cell back to resting potential 
	5. --- see chart/graphic
4. Action Potentials (All or Nothing)
	1. Voltage gated ion channels
		1. Na+ or K+
		2. Only open at thresholds
		3. More and more will open until maximum potential is reached
	2. Small stimulus
		1. Ex: pain receptor, olfactory receptor, etc. 
		2. Creates a positive change
		3. Allows a little Na+ to leak in 
			1. Slight depolarization
		4. Still doesn't reach threshold
			1. Stimulus must reach -55 threshold
			2. Neuron isn't fired
			3. Failed initiation
	3. Strong stimulus
		1. Na+ leaks in
		2. Threshold is reached
			1. Cell is depolarized and action potential created
		3. Neuron then stimulates another neuron (like dominoes)
	4. Action Potential Figure![[Pasted image 20230324111447.png]]
		1. Know all parts of this figure!
		2. Arrow going up = depolarization
		3. Arrow going down = Repolarization
		4. Resting potential = -70mV
		5. Threshold is about -55mV
		6. Step 1 - Na+ channels open in response to stimulus and Na+ enters the cell
			1. Depolarization begins
		7. Step 2 - K+ channels open and K+ begins to leave cell
			1. Reaches +50 mV (peak)
		8. Step 3 - Na+ channels close and K+ leaves cell
		9. Step 4 - K+ channels close
		10. Brief moment where cell is hyperpolarized and cannot fire again
	5. Overload of Potassium
		1. Lethal injection
		2. Cells must be able to move sodium in cells and potassium out to create action potential 
			1. If a bunch of K+ outside cell, then cell cannot work hard enough to create action potential so nerves cannot fire
5. Self-Propagation and Message Speed
	1. Action potential happens throughout the axon
	2. As you depolarize one part, the next part is then depolarized and so on. . .
		1. Domino effect or The Wave
		2. This is how an *unmyelinated axon* propagates the signal along the neuron
			1. Ex: squids
	3. Influx of Na -> depolarize adjacent 
	4. Most of our cells are myelinated
		1. A message through a tube is restricted by diameter
			1. Called *resistance*
			2. Increase in diameter = less resistance
				1. Makes signal flow through more readily
			3. Adding insulation w/ the Swann's cells w/ nodes in-between
				1. ---
			4. Signal jumps from node to node
				1. AP occurs *notes only*
				2. This means we can have a smaller neuron but still have faster signal
				4. This is called *saltatory conduction*
		2. ![[Pasted image 20230324112553.png]]
6. Neural Synapses
	1. We receive signal through dendrite, sent through cell body, AP through axon, all the way to the axon terminal
		1. Axon terminals interact w/ other cells
	2. Synaptic cleft
		1. A type of intercellular junction
			1. Faster communication than direct contact for the type of message
		2. The space between neuron and other neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells
			1. Neuromuscular junction = neuron -> muscle cell
				1. Important for muscular contraction
		3. Signal from one structure to another structure w/ space in-between
	3. Presynaptic cell
		1. Axon -> synapse
		2. Before the synapse
		3. Transmitter
	4. Postsynaptic cell
		1. Synapse -> cell
		2. After the synapse
		3. Receiver
	5. Chemical Synapse
		1. No direct connection 
		2. Chemical called *neurotransmitter* is released into the synaptic cleft
			1. Chemical form of the signal
		3. Synapse is 20 to 40 nm wide
		4. Synaptic vesicles
			1. ---
		5. AP -> NT -> AP
			1. AP of presynaptic cell (electrical) -> neurotransmitter (chemical form of signal) -> Causes AP of postsynaptic cell (electrical)
		6. Process
			1. Nerve impulse
			2. AP stimulates CA^2
			3. Exocytosis of NTs
			4. NTs -> Synapse
			5. NTs bind to ligand-gated channels (opens the channels)
				1. Ligand-gated channels require a chemical to open them (NT) unlike voltage-gated channels
				2. Open so that Na+ can enter the cell
					1. Causes depolarization and propagates AP
			6. NT duration is tightly controlled by enzymes, ---
				1. Whenever NT is attached, sodium is allowed to enter
				2. Must be closely Sigcontrolled to prevent constant APs
					1. Don't want neuron to always be "on"
				3. Enzymes clean NT off and recycle them
					1. Gets them ready for the next pulse
7. Neurotransmitters
	1. A substance that transmits nerve impulses across a synapse
		1. Chemical
		2. Stored in synaptic vesicles
		3. Exocytosis by pre-synaptic cell
	2. Main action
		1. Passes into synaptic cleft
		2. Binds w/ post-synaptic cell
		3. Helps transfer nerve impulses
		4. Can either excite or inhibit the cell
	3. See list of neurotransmitters
	4. Regulation
		1. Enzymatic action
		2. Removes and recycles
		3. Specific enzyme for each neurotransmitter
	5. Acetylcholine (ACh)
		1. Ligand that binds at neuromuscular junction
			1. Motor neuron -> muscle fiber
		2. Excitatory postsynaptic potential
			1. Postsynaptic potential (AP -> excitatory)
				1. If ligand binds and opens Na+ channel, it is *excitatory*
					1. Signal propagates and leads to successful muscle contraction 
			2. May lead to depolarization
	6. gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
		1. Important inhibitor of brain function
		2. Increased effectiveness of anxiety medications
		3. See structure ---
		4. Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential 
			1. Bind w/ ligand-gated Cl- (AP -> inhibitory)
				1. Ligand-gated chloride channel
					1. When CL- enters cell, makes cell more negative (*hyperpolarizes* it)
					2. Cannot be stimulated (*inhibitory*)
			2. CL- outside -> diffuses into neuron
	7. Other Neurotransmitters
		1. Norepinephrine = "fight or flight" response
		2. Dopamine = body movement, linked w/ pleasure pathway
			1. Drinking, overeating, addiction, etc. stimulate this
		3. Serotonin = regulation of sleep and emotional states
			1. Depression = too little
			2. Prozac = prevents re-uptake
		4. Enkephalins and Endorphins = Neuropeptide, inhibit passage of pain info
			1. Opioids are chemically similar and bind preferentially
				1. Can become so good at stimulating it that natural NTs become less effective
				2. Drumming down ligand receptors

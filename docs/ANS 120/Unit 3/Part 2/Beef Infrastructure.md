1. [[Beef]] infrastructure involves the levels or segments of the industry
	- Purebreeders - Seedstock = Providing bulls for genetic base to sell to cow/calf operations
		1. One bull can breed many cows so can have many more offspring than an individual cow
			- Can breed 30-50 cows
			- Better to look at bull genetics bc they can be more widely spread
		2. Specialized cow-calf producers
		3. Provide the genetic material to beef supply chain
			- Breeding animals
			- Semen (<3% of all beef cattle AI)
				1. Not practical outside of these purebred herds
				2. 99% of all semen and embryo transfer occurs within this purebreeder group. Barely occurs outside of the group in beef cattle overall.
			- Embryos (<1%)
		4. Looking for novelty
			- Small, specialized group
				1. Most looking for enhancing meat production
			- Ex: Scottish Highlander, Texas Longhorn, Ankole-Watusi, Miniature Cattle
			- Mostly for fun but don't fit normal beef production
	- Commercial Cow/Calf = Producing one weaned calf every 365 days
		1. Largest infrastructure group
		2. Calving interval = 12 month
		3. Two major groups
			- Meat production (all steers + about 60% of heifers)
			- Replacement heifers (40% to start w/)
		4. Weaned = Separation of dam from offspring
			- 5-7 months and weigh about 400-600 lbs.
		5. Extensive Crossbreeding
			- >80% crossbred
			- Heterosis = Average of the crossbreed offspring are higher/superior in given *traits* compared to the average performance the parental breeds
				1. Due to increased heterozygosity 
				2. Certain traits respond to this
					- Ex: weaning weight/cow exposed. Weaning Weight (how much cow weighs at weaning determined by maternal ability, survival, early growth rate, etc.) and Cow Exposed (of all cows exposed to a bull, how many reproduce). 
					- Carcass is not a heterosis trait (meat characteristic do not demonstrate heterosis)
						1. Carcass meets in middle between parents. Not heterosis.
					- Traits such as reproduction and calf survivability demonstrate heterosis
			- Two breed rotation
				1. Pasture one starts w/ Breed A. Pasture 2 starts w/ Breed B. Rotate female offspring to other pasture. Then rotate those female offspring. And continue.
				2. 15% increase in reproduction rate.
			- Three breed rotation
				1. Pasture one starts w/ Breed A. Pasture 2 starts w/ Breed B. Pasture 3 starts w/ Breed C
				2. 23% increase in weaning weight per cow exposed to bull
					- More heterosis bc greater genetic diversity
			- Four breed rotation increases weaning weight per cow exposed by 24%
				1. Increase in heterosis rate starts to slow bc there can only be so much heterozygosity at an allele level
				2. Maximal heterozygosity of alleles in genes about reached by 3 breed rotation 
			- Why is it so difficult to produce a weaned calf each 365 days?
				1. Extremely hard to produce a calf each 365 days
				2. 365 days w/ 285 day gestation. 
				3. About 80 days to breed the animal. 
				4. Uterine involution takes about 35-40 days (uterine involution is repair of uterus so that next gestation is feasible) 
				5. Lactational anestrous (Production and synthesis of milk tends to interfere w/ resumption of normal estrous cycles) takes 60 days (occurs simultaneously w/ uterine involution)
				6. This leaves 20 days to rebreed (Estrous cycle is 21 days so about one chance to get conception in order to produce one calf per year)
					- On the avg there would only be one opportunity to achieve conception
					- Many things that could go wrong and hurt chances further
	- Stocker
		1. In between weaned calf but before animal goes to feedlot
			- Between 400-600 lbs. weaning weight and 800-900 lbs. for feedlot
			- Between 5-7 months and 9-11 months 
		2. Natural Maturation
			- Increase frame (skeletal) size
			- Increase muscle development
			- Calf --> Adult
		1. Forage for 4-7 months
			- Low energy ration
			- Pasture 
			- Crop residue
	- Feedlot
		2. Weigh 800-900 lbs. and are about 8-10 months
		3. Very few countries can afford to have feedlots
		4. Take from stocker operation and from 2-3 months (50d-120d) --> 1100-1200 lbs.
			- Objective is not to make them heavier, just side effect of operation
			- Excess fat is not helpful
		5. Objectives
			- Increase intramuscular fat (marbling)
				1. Different from making them fatter
			- Influence taste of fat
				1. Taste of meat is similar to what they ate
				2. Less "game" flavor bc they feed corn for unified taste
			- Influence color of fat
				1. We make it white by what we feed them
				2. Corn = white
		6. Grain finished animals
			- Eat whole corn plant, not just kernel
		7. Grass Fed vs Grain Finished
			- Different, not better or worse
			- Grain finished - Feedlot
				1. 14-16 months
				2. Pasture range = 9-12m
				3. Feedlot - 50-120d
					- Fed whole corn plants
					- Fat color = white
					- Fat content = high (grade dependent)
					- Connective tissue = lower
						1. More tender
						2. Aged <72 hrs
					- Lower carbon footprint
			- Grass finished
				1. >2 years age (3-5 common)
				2. Pasture/range only
					- Fat color = yellow/orange
					- Fat content = varies composition and amount (not USDA graded)
					- Fat flavor = varies
					- Connective tissue = increases
						1. Less tender
						2. Aged up to 20d
					- Higher carbon footprint
	- Packers = Disassembly plant
		1. Taking live animal --> slaughter process --> processing (breaking down into meat and side products)
		2. Four companies process over 80 percent of all beef produced
			- 35 million head of cattle annually
		3. Slaughter process where animals rendered unconscious 
			- Then skinning and blood draining
			- Then age in cooler for around 72 hours
		4. Boxed beef vs sides of carcasses 
			- Boxed beef has specific cuts in each box and easier for transport + storage
				1. Encourages uniformity of animal that meets the needs of consumer
			- Other method is sending carcasses to local butchers who then cut the meat
				1. More difficult to transport
			- Box method easier than older carcass method
		5. Can be very dangerous job w/ large animals and heavy equipment
			- Highly skilled workers 
		6. Products made from cattle
			- Utilize 99.7% of animal
			- Many different cuts of meat
			- Cosmetics, explosives, drywall, fertilizer, brake fluid, adhesives, plastics, medical materials, leather, textiles, etc. 
		7. Grading slaughter cattle carcasses
			- Quality grade = Prediction of palatability (good flavor and texture)
				1. Age of animal at processing
					- Younger animals should have better palatability (less connective tissue)
					- If less connective tissue, it is more tender
					- Any animal under 42 months of age is high quality grade. If over, not high quality
					- Most animals are in A category (most are about 12-16 months)
				2. Intramuscular fat
					- Fat within muscle fibers (between individual muscle fibers)
					- Commonly called marbling
					- Increasing intramuscular majorly improves taste and tenderness
				3. Top grades
					- Prime = young w/ lots of intramuscular fat
						1. Very expensive bc it takes a lot more feed
					- Choice = young w/ moderate intramuscular fat
						1. Most common
					- Select = young w/ some intramuscular fat
				4. Older animals
					- Commercial, Utility, Cutter
					- Usually old dairy cows
			- Yield grade = Proportion of primary retail cuts of meat compared to carcass
				1. Live animal --> removal of internal organs, skin, head, and feet --> carcass
				2. Proportion of major meat cuts compared to carcass
					- Amount of primary meat cuts from a carcass 
				3. Parts of carcass are not major meat cut (still used for other purposes)
				4. Grades 
					- Scale of 1-5
						1. 1 = more product per carcass
							- Less fat
						2. 5 = less product per carcass
							- More fat
					- We trim fat on edge off so a 1 has more meat and less excess exterior fat
					- Relationship of quality grade to yield grade
						1. Inverse relationship
							- As one gets more favorable, the other gets less favorable
							- Ex: if we increase quality grade, we tend to have a less favorable yield grade. Prime has more excess back fat and therefore is higher on the yield grade scale (worse yield)
							- Prime = higher grade (less favorable) whereas select is lower grade (more favorable)
						2. Optimal is choice quality and around 2-2.5 yield
					- Wagyu cattle = Extreme marbling (intramuscular fat)
						1. National treasure in Japan
						2. Super expensive
						3. Japan does not have much grain but feed cattle socky (alcohol)
							- High in empty calories

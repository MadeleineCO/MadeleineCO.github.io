1. Two powerful strategies for genetic change
	1. Selection = deciding which individuals to retain as parents that will contribute genes to subsequent generations 
		1. Helps us change the *gene (or allelic) frequencies*
			1. Mating systems changes the *genotypic frequencies*
			2. Goal is to increase the frequency of alleles w/ desirable effects and decrease freq of alleles w/ undesirable effects 
	2. Mating systems = which males mated to which females
		1. Does *not* change allelic frequencies, only genotype frequencies
			1. Selection changes the frequency of the alleles
				2. Mating Systems alters genotypic frequencies or the proportion of homo vs hetero
				3. Application of mating system leads to no further changes in allelic frequency beyond those accomplished by selection 
			2. Alters genotypic frequencies, or the prop of homo vs hetero individuals in offspring generation 
2. Random Mating Systems
	1. [[Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium]] requires a randomly mating population
	2. Constant frequencies from gen to gen
	3. Genotypic frequencies depend upon allelic frequencies
		1. p + q = 1 (allelic)
		2. p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 (genotypic)
3. Non-Random Mating Systems
	1. Involves strategies for genetic change
	2. Selection generally has a goal in mind
		1. Do we want animals that are more related? less related? look alike? tall? red coat?
	3. Assignment of mates can be based on. . .
		1. Genetic relationship
			1. Based on pedigree
			2. [[Inbreeding]]
			3. [[Outbreeding]]
			4. Additive Genetic Relationship
				1. Proportion of genes that two individuals have in common
				2. Describes the added genetic likeness of the two individuals in question
				3. Numerical value from 0 to 1
					1. Since additive genetic relationship is a probability, it must be within this range
					2. Two animals can have anywhere from none to all genes identical by descent
				4. Ex: Holstein cows have more genes in common w/ other Holsteins than say Jerseys
			5. By looking at genetic relationships, we attempt to quantify the *proportion of genes* within two individuals that are *identical by descent*
			6. Computing Rxy (the relationship of x and y)
			$$Rxy = \frac{\sum 1/2^{n}(1+Fa)}{\sqrt{(1+Fx)(1+Fy)}}$$
		2. Phenotypic similarity 
			1. Based on performance
			2. Mate the male and female bc they. . .
				1. Resemble one another more closely (for a trait) than if chosen at random from the pop
					1. Positive assortative mating
				2. Resemble one another less closely
					1. Disassortative or negative assortative mating
			3. Ex: red coat to red coat, tall w/ tall 
				1. Positive assortative mating 
					1. Leads to increase in homozygosity
					2. Similar genetic effects to inbreeding
						1. Inbreeding depression
			4. Ex: tall w/ short, black coat to white coat
				1. Negative assortative mating
					1. Leads to increase in heterozygosity
					2. Can see similar genetic effects as outbreeding
						1. Heterosis
	4. Non-Random Mating Systems Summary
		1. Does *not* alter allelic frequencies
			1. Goal of non-random mating systems is to alter genotypic frequencies
		2. Inbreeding & positive assortative mating increases homozygosity
			1. Outbreeding & negative assortative mating increases heterozygosity

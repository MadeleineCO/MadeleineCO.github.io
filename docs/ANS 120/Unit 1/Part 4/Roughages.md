1. [[Feed Classifications]]
2. NOT fruits, grains, seeds, or tubers 
3. Includes plant stems and leaves
4. High in fiber and low in energy (nutrients)
	1. Fiber: Cellulose (+ related components such as lignin, hemicellulose, wood)
		- Used for structure in plants
		- The higher the fiber, the less room for nutrients
	2. Proteinaceous
		- Higher in protein than other roughages (still low amounts relative to concentrates)
		- Crude Protein (CP) is generally greater than 15% protein
		- Alfalfa
			- Symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium spp. (spp. = species)
				1. Bacteria that live in root nodules of plants
				2. Can take nitrogen out of air and fix it into plants
				3. Nitrogen is the basis of amino acids and proteins so increases protein production in the plant
			- Can be dangerous if too much protein
				- Lower in fiber than most roughages (higher in nutrients)
		- Clover
	1. Carbonaceous
		- Grasses
			- Bermuda
			- Fescue
			- Orchard grass
			- Timothy
			- Crop residue
				1. Ex: Stems from wheat
		- Low in protein and other nutrients but high in fiber
5. Importance
	- Critical for ruminants and non-ruminant herbivores
		- Provide feed substrate for microbial digestion
		- Maintains gastrointestinal tract (GIT) integrity
			1. Horses need a bunch of it to prevent colic to keep digestive track full
6. Storage

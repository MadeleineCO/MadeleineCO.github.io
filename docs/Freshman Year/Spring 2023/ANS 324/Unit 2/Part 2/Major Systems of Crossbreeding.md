1. Terminal System
	1. All offspring of terminal system sold into the market
	2. Downside is that you do not keep replacement animals 
	3. Advantages are that you can produce uniform offspring and heterosis is maximized 
	4. Easiest method
	5. Ex of three terminal system ![[Pasted image 20230303102652.png]]
	6. Ex: of two breed terminal cross
		7. Rambouillet ewe x Suffolk ram
			1. Offspring to market
		8. Major genetic benefit of system
			1. Direct heterosis 
			2. ---
		9. Rambouillet chosen due to maternal traits and adaptability to env
		10. Suffolk chosen due to growth rate and carcass merit
		11. Major genetic limitation
			1. Does not benefit from maternal heterosis 
	7. Major management limitation
		1. Always need provision of replacement females
		2. Must purchase
		3. Need reliable, healthy, and economic source
	8. Ex - 1950s
		1. Herefords were dominant breed in US
		2. Herefords adapted to region
		3. Good demand for feeder calves
		4. Ranches began calving heifers for first time at 2 yrs vs 3 yrs old
		5. Coupled w/ selection of bulls for growth rate
			1. Also caused higher rates of dystocia due to higher birth rates
		6. Solution = mate first calf Hereford heifers to Angus bulls
			1. Angus known to produce low birthweight cows
		7. But still needed Hereford heifers as replacements 
			1. For 2nd and subsequent matings, Hereford cows mated to Hereford bulls
				1. Provision of desired purebred Hereford replacement females
		8. Terminal crossing was used to solve a particular problem
			1. Gained direct heterosis for growth
			2. Improved survival of crossbred cows
	9. Three Breed Terminal Cross
		1. F1 crossbred females from two maternal breeds mated to males of sire breed
			1. Sires chosen for growth and carcass traits
		2. Genetically superior to two breeds
		3. Utilizes both maternal and direct heterosis
		4. Increased breed complementation
			1. Both maternal breeds chosen for maternal traits 
				1. Maternal traits include. . .
					1. Adaptability to env
					2. High merit for reproduction
					3. Milk production
					4. Mothering ability
				2. Drawback
					1. Purchase ---
2. Rotational System
	1. Rotate between two or more breeds
	2. Allows production of herd replacements
	4. Two breed rotation ex:
		1. 1st year - A x B = AB (50% - 50%)
		2. 2nd year - AB x A = AB (75% - 25%)
		3. 3rd year - AB x B = AB (37.5% - 62.5%)
		4. 4th year - AB x A = AB (68.7% - 32.3%)
	5. Three breed rotation ex:
		1. 1st year - A x B = AB (50% - 50%)
		2. 2nd yr - AB x C = ABC (25% - 25% - 50%)
		3. 3rd yr - ABC x A = ABC (62.5% - 12.5% - 25%)
		4. 4th yr - ABC x B  =ABC
	6. Advantage is that it allows you to save replacement females
	7. Downside is that all animals are crossbred at some point
		1. Additionally, different levels of ages and gene combinations in your herd
			1. Animals will not be uniform
			2. After several generations, all dams and offspring will be crossbred
		2. Involves more investment than terminal
	8. Original purebred dams will be replaced by crossbred descendants
		1. Offspring and dams benefit from both direct and maternal heterosis
		2. They do *not* benefit from *maximum* potential heterosis
			1. Since each breed is eventually used on both female and male sides of the cross
			2. Offspring always inherit some proportion of non-heterotic gene combinations
	9. Four breed systems retain more heterosis than three breed
		1. Less popular bc more complex to manage and easier to find three breeds that compliment well
	10. In terminal crossbreeding, you can choose maternal and paternal breeds for sire and dam, but in rotational, --- 
		1. Terminal crosses also have more uniform offspring than in rotational
			1. In rotational, overlap of generations within herd at any one time
				1. Different aged females belonging to different generations
		2. ----
			1. To make appropriate matings
				1. Two sire breeds needed each year
			2. Produce calves that are 2/3 Angus and 2/3 Hereford
				1. Variability in calf crop vs calf crop in terminal crossbreeding program
			3. In rotational, ---
3. Rotaterminal
	1. Combination
		1. Tries to take advantages of terminal w/ advantages of rotation
		2. --- (~ 12 minutes)
		4. Males are usually not good market animals but can be used to produce good females
		5. Involves more investment than terminal and rotational
		6. Uniformity is a challenge
			1. Different ages of animals 
		7. Advantages is that you can both sell terminal animals and keep replacement animals

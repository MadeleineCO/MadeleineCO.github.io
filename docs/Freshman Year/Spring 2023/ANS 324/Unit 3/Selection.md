1. Two strategies available to breeders for genetic improvement
	1. [[Mating Systems]]
	2. Selection
2. Over time, the desired effect cumulates 
	1. How did we go from ancestor of dog to the many different breeds we have today?
	2. Both appearance and behavior can be changed
3. Selection = Man's (or woman's) most effective means to influence rate of genetic change
	1. Allows us to use fewer animals to meet our food needs
4. Rate of genetic change w/ selection depends on several factors
	1. Heritability (h^2)
		1. Higher h^2 = faster rate of change
	2. Selection Differential
		1. The mean value of selected individual minus the mean value of pop from which they were selected 
			1. X (individual) - mean of X (pop)
		2. Large differential = faster rate of change
		3. We select for extremes (greater selection differential)
	3. Population size
		1. Greater size = greater superiority 
			1. Results in greater variation so more potential for genetic progress
			2. Variation is the raw material for selection
	4. Generation interval
		1. The average number of years for turnover of a pop
		2. Shorter = better for selection
			1. The smaller the generation interval, the faster the rate of change
		3. Ex: if male is 24 and female is 22, then avg generation interval is 23
			1. Age at which they had their first child
5. Basis for Selection: Sources of Information
	1. Different ways to get info to make selection decisions 
	2. Must be accurate data w/ solid science
	3. When you select sire and dam, you are selecting them out of the pop w/ a goal to change the pop over time
	4. Several sources of info
		1. Individual performance records
			1. Can record this yourself
			2. Measuring the animals 
				1. Scrotum circumference, feed efficiency, etc.
			3. Most commonly used
			4. Value is highly related to h^2
				1. Very good for *highly h^2 traits*
				2. Ex: growth traits such as birth weight, weaning weight, yearling weight, avg daily gain, and feed efficiency 
				3. Ex: carcass traits such as intramuscular fat, fat thickness, and REA
				4. Ex: milk production traits such as milk yield, milk fat, and protein %
			5. Disadvantages
				1. Not good for sex-limited traits
					1. Ex: Can't measure a bull for milk yield
				2. Can't rely on individual performance for traits that require a long time to appear
					1. Ex: puberty
				3. Can't measure carcass traits where animal must be slaughtered to take measurements
					1. Animal is already dead by this point
				4. Low accuracy for lowly h^2 traits
					1. h^2 < 0.2
		2. Pedigree
			1. Looking at ancestors to make predictions
			2. How did the parents perform?
		3. Collateral relatives
			1. Looking at performance of siblings
				1. How are the related females performing?
			2. Can look at both full and half siblings
		4. Progeny
			1. The best way to measure the genetic worth of an animal 
			2. Progeny testing 
6. Accuracy of Selection
	1. The relative reliability of estimates that we are using to make selection decisions
	2. Statistically
		1. Estimates how accurately the genotype of the individual for a certain trait can be predicted from the phenotypic averages of its relatives 
	3. EX: birth weight is negative 5, weaning weight is 10, and yearling weight of 50
		1. The other bull has BW of -2, WW of 8, and YW of 38
		2. The offspring of the bulls will be --- lbs heavier or lighter than the avg of the population at --- time
			1. Ex: The offspring of the first bull will be 5 lbs lighter than the avg of the population at birth
		3. The first bull is more desirable than the second bull bc lighter birth weight but heavier later on 
		4. However, we also have accuracy measures for these predictions
	4. Does not suggest genetic net worth of an animal
	5. Accuracy of estimate will change over time
		1. More information improves accuracy
	6. US MARC
		1. Research center in Nebraska that generates numbers annually for animals
7. Estimating Breeding Value
	1. For a single trait. . .$$EBV = \frac{h^{2}(x - x\bar{})}{h}$$
		1. X = individual performance
		2. Bar x = ...
		3. ...
		4. Why divide by 2? 
			1. Half of genetic potential from animal X
			2. Each parent contributes half to the next generation
	2. In avg herd, animal being bred by X is avg
	3. Ex: Post weaning ADG
		1. Must look at. . .
			1. h^2
			2. Selection differential (x - mx)
			3. Pop size
			4. Generation interval (Gi)
		2. H^2 = 0.6
		3. X = 3.5
		4. Mean X = 3.0
		5. EBV = 0.15
			1. 0.6(3.5 - 3.0) / 2 (using the EBV formula to get 0.15)
		6. Can then calculate EPD
			1. Estimated Progeny Difference
				1. Difference of progeny in comparison to avg of pop
			2. EPD = 3.15 (using the following formula)
				1. That is the deviation from the mean
				 $$EPD = EBV + x\bar{}$$
				 2. This should change little as it is affected by bull's genetics
					 1. Improvement is static
		7. Progress/year = EBV/Gi
			1. Gi = Generation Interval
			2. Common Gis
				1. Horse = 8-12
				2. Cattle = 4-6
				3. Sheep = 3-5
				4. Swine = 1.5-2
				5. Chicken = 1-1.5
			3. 0.15/5 = 0.03 lb/yr (using the above formula)
	4. Accuracy for Individual Performance
		1. Based on one record
		2. Accuracy = $\sqrt{h^{2}}$
			1. Ex: h^2 = 0.6, so accuracy = 0.77
		3. The higher the heritability, the greater the accuracy
8. Pedigree
	1. Information based on ancestor performance
		1. Degree of relationship
			1. Parents = 1/2
			2. Grandparents = 1/4
			3. Great grandparents = 1/8
			4. As you move further up the pedigree, amount of genes in common reduces and they are less related
		2. h^2 of trait 
		3. Must have good env correlation between ancestor and individual
			1. The animal must be raised in same env as ancestor
		4. Traits must me measured in same way as ancestor
			1. Ex: heart guard (circumference of heart) must be measured in same spot in parent as in offspring
	2. Advantages
		1. Cheap
		2. Valuable for sex-limited traits
			1. Individual performance records are not good for sex-limited traits
			2. Can look at ancestors of the opposite sex
		3. Valuable for traits expressed later in life
		4. Good for lowly heritable traits
			1. Individual performance is not good for low h^2 traits 
		5. Attention to records of ancestors increases accuracy of selection
	3. Disadvantages
		1. Lack of accurate records/env influences of ancestors performance records
			1. Any mistakes can be costly
		2. Provides no comparative basis for selection among individuals that are all descendants of the same ancestor
			1. Siblings expected to have equal performance, but this is not usually the case
9. Collateral Relatives
	1. Using information from full sibs (same parents) or half sibs (one parent in common)
		1. More useful when dealing w/ full sibs than half sibs
		2. Full sibs = 1/2 related
		3. Half sibs = 1/4 related
			1. Accuracy better if they share mother vs father
	2. Advantages
		1. Good for sex-limited traits
			1. Can look at sisters or brothers
		2. Good for traits that require slaughter to measure
		3. Accuracy tends to be lower than the individual performance
			1. Exception = low h^2 traits bc increased num of observations
	3. Factors affecting accuracy of sib test
		1. h^2 of trait
		2. Relationship of sib (closeness)
			1. Higher accuracy in full sibs than half sibs
		3. Number of sibs tested
			1. More = better accuracy
		4. Correlation between phenotypes of sibs 
			1. Environmental correlation
			2. Full sibs have same maternal env from conception to weaning
			3. Involves G x E interactions
				1. Genotype by env interactions
	4. Table 9.12 (see handout)
		1. Accuracy of selection based on trait performance of full sibs at predicting individual's performance
		2. If h^2 = 0.4, records of 4 full sibs, then 0.5 accurate at predicting individual's performance
	5. Table 9.13 (see handout)
		1.  ---
		2. Sibs more accurate than individual records if low h^2
			1. Number of offspring (observations)
			2. More siblings = increased accuracy
	6. Table 9.10 (see handout)
		1. ---
		2. Lower half sib accuracy than full sib accuracy
		3. For h^2 = 0.4, takes well over 100 half sibs to equal 0.5 accuracy of selection
	7. Table 9.11 (see handout)
		1. ---
10. Progeny Testing
	1. The evaluation of the genetic makeup of an individual by phenotype of it's progeny
		1. Looking at the performance of the progeny to rank the parents
	2. The best answer to the question of "genetic worth" of an animal
		1. For both qualitative and quantitative traits
	3. Progeny Testing w/ Qualitative Traits
		1. Main objective = determine the likelihood that an animal is a carrier of a detrimental recessive allele
		2. Ex: CID in Arabians ([[Equine Selection]])
			1. CID = combined immunodeficiency
				1. AKA SID (severe combined immunodeficiency)
			2. In foals, the immune system doesn't turn on when it's supposed to
				1. Passive immunity = immunity from mother 
					1. Wears off after a while so animal is expected to be able to protect itself but can't in CID
			3. DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA PKcs)
				1. Malfunction
			4. Foal ends up w/ an infection and dies
				1. Lethal
			5. It is an autosomal recessive trait
				1. Both parents must be heterozygotes for offspring to express this
				2. There is a locus test so you can prevent this
			6. Foal is susceptible to infection as maternal Ab wanes (the passive immunity)
				1. After two months, Ig levels decrease, infection, death
		3. Factors affecting the "success" of progeny test for qualitative traits
			1. Genetic make-up of test animal (genotypes available)
			2. The number of offspring that can be produced
				1. More offspring = better test success 
		4. Test Matings
			1. Number of offspring required to determine the likelihood that an animal is *not* a carrier of a detrimental trait depends on type of potential cross
			2. ---
		 1. Sire x recessive (H_ x hh)
			 1. Advantage = fewer matings required
			 2. Disadvantage = finding recessive animals
		 2. Sire x heterozygote (H_ x Hh)
			 1. Advantage = known carrier
			 2. Disadvantage = Must ID animals, More matings involved
		 3. Sire x daughter (H_ x H_)
			 1. Advantage = easier to obtain
			 2. Disadvantage = ---
	 1. Progeny Testing w/ Quantitative Traits
		 1. Major objective = determining BV of parents
		 2. Offspring represent 1/2 BV of parents
			1. This is the basis for EPDs and EBVs
				1. EBV = (h^2(x - mx)) / 2
				2. EPD = EBV + mx
		1. Factors Affecting Accuracy of PT for Quantitative Traits
			1. Dams must be random
			2. Offspring must be tested in the same env
				1. Performance = G + E
				2. Env is anything apart from the genes
				3. Must control for G x E Interactions 
			3. Must compare parents of similar age (another factor of env)
			4. Increased num of progeny = increased accuracy
			5. Table 9.7
				1. See handout
				2. ---
			6. As h^2 increases ---
			7. ---
1. Selection for more than one trait
	1. Net value of animal dependent upon several traits
		1. Traits may not be of equal economic value
		2. Ex: looking at both BW and YW
			1. Want BW to be low but YW to be high
			2. Not possible to buy a bull based on one single trait
			3. But these traits may not be of equal economic value
		3. Traits may be independent of one another
			1. Could have an opposing relationship
			2. Ex: MY and MF
				1. Inverse relationship
	2. Three basic methods
		1. Tandem
			1. Allows you to focus on one trait at a time
			2. Ex: may select for BW until you have animal w/ consistently low BW
				1. Then begin to select for another trait
			3. Old, inefficient method
				1. No longer used
			4. Select for one trait, then another, then a third. . .
			5. Problems . . .
				1. May have opposing genetic relationship between traits
				2. More traits = slower progress
				3. ---
		2. Independent Culling Method
			1. Still being used, but has stringent rules so may not provide the best animal
			2. You create a minimum standard and select for those standards
				1. If animal fails one of those standards, must be culled
				2. Animal that falls below minimum level in any trait is culled
			3. Problem. . .
				1. Cull animal that may be outstanding in another trait
			4. ---
			5. For a pig to be safe for breeding:
				1. Must be from litter of at least 8 weaned
				2. Must weigh 180 lbs at 5 months of age
				3. No more than 1.3 inches of backfat at 200 lb live weight
				4. Ex:
					1. Pig 8
						1. Litter of 9 weaned
						2. 185 lb at 5 months
						3. 1.3 inches of backfat
					2. Pig B 
						1. Litter of 5 weaned
						2. 225 lb at 5 months
						3. 0.95 inches of backfat
					3. Pig B must be culled bc didn't meat first requirement but better animal overall 
					4. Shows limitation of independent culling method
			6. Selection Index
				1. Creates an index w/ weighted averages
					1. Like a GPA for the animals 
					2. Some traits get more points (weight) than other traits
					3. Different degrees of emphasis on traits of interest
						1. Then you make an equation to determine the genetic worth of an animal (based on your objectives)
						2. Separate ---
							1. ---
				2. The better approach
					1. Widely used
				3. I = b1x1 + b2x2 + ... bnxn
					1. I = index value
					2. ---
				4. Ex: Beef producer - cow/calf stocker
					1. WW (0.4)
						1. 500
						2. 200
					2. Post ADG (0.3)
						1. 2.5
						2. 0.75
					3. YW (0.3)
						1. 1000
						2. 300
					4. But must be put on trait/ratio basis
						1. 100 = herd avg
						2. X/Xm  x 100 = trait ratio
				5. A single number that predicts the BV of an individual for a weighted combination of traits
				6. BLUP
					1. Best Linear Unbiased Prediction
						1. An extension of selection index
						2. Method of genetic prediction (for selection) that allows you to compare animals of different contemporary groups
							1. Corrects for differences in env (ex age, herd)
							2. ---
					2. Simultaneous solution of number of equations using matrix algebra
2. Keys for Selection Based on More than One Trait
	1. Must consider *genetic relationship* among traits
		1. Either + or -
			1. *Correlated response* = when you select for one trait and experience improvement or decline in another trait
		2. *Strength* of relationship differs
	2. Must consider *number of traits *selecting for
		1. More traits = slower progress
	3. Must consider *h^2 *of traits
		1. If highly h^2, you can easily select for >1 trait
		2. If lowly h^2, you can not select for many traits at the same time

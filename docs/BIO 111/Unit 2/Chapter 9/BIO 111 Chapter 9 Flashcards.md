Communication between cells requires ---::ligand (signaling molecule) and receptor protein (molecule to which receptor binds); Interaction of these components initiates process of signal transduction, which converts info in signal into cellular response
^1664412028590

Ligands could be ---::protein, small molecule, gas, physical connection etc; Different ways to signal
^1664412028603

Four basic communication mechanisms::Direct contact, paracine, endocrine, synaptic
^1664412028609

Direct contact::"Receive the squeeze"; Rapid (instantaneous) but localized
^1664412028615

Paracrine signaling::Nearby cells; Ligand and receptor not touching (ligand is released then binds to the receptor); Can be moderately quick; Inflammation is one type of paracrine signaling
^1664412028621

Endocrine signaling::Ligands travel long distances to get to receptors; Relatively slow but long-lasting and powerful; Sex hormones
^1664412028627

Synaptic signaling::Don't touch, but precise distance between where ligands are released and receptors; Very fast (almost instant) and can span great distances; Travels very quickly for the distances involved; Pain receptors in fingers zip a signal from brain and from brain to fingers, but response is almost instant because of speed
^1664412028633

Some cells send signals to themselves::A fifth type/version of paracrine; Autocrine signaling
^1664412028639

Signal transduction::Events within the cell that occur in response to a signal (ex: when a ligand binds to a receptor protein); Different cell types can respond differently to the same signal
^1664412028647

Epinephrine example of signal transduction::Can bind to different receptors causing unintended side effects; Challenging for pharmaceutical industry
^1664412028654

Synaptic gap::The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell; Very small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitters; Enzymes in the synaptic cleft degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.
^1664412028660

Synaptic signaling is a ---::very specialized form of paracrine signaling across synaptic gaps through neurotransmitters
^1664574050793

Enzymes in the synaptic cleft degrade ---::some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal; (ex acetylcholine can make muscles contract so if signal is not turned off, muscle will use all its energy as it keeps firing)
^1664574050804

Neurons::Have long skinny piece called axon, which is connected to the cell body (holds the nucleus) and the axon terminal on the other side; Dendrites surround the cell body and neurotransmitters that emit from the axon terminal can bind to these on another cell
^1664574050811

Signals go one direction across neurons from ---::dendrites down across cell body and axon to the axon terminal
^1664574050817

Neurons cannot ---::divide/reproduce through mitosis (ex paralysis cant heal itself)
^1664574050824

Synaptic receptors can be in --- or non neural cells such as ---::dendrites on neurons; muscles (neuromuscular junctions = when neurons bind via neurotransmitters to muscle cells)
^1664574050830

Synaptic signals can be ---::excitatory or inhibitory; Excitatory and inhibitory signals can both bind on a neuron and have opposite effects
^1664574050836

SSRI drugs::Antidepressants; Sometimes serotonin gets destroyed by enzymes too quickly (leads to depression bc not enough effect) so these drugs slow the breaking down of serotonin
^1664574050842

Receptors can be defined by their ---::location; Intracellular (located within a cell) and intercellular (between several cells)
^1664574050848

Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors) are located ---::on the plasma membrane to bind a ligand outside the cell; Transmembrane protein in contact w/ both cytoplasm and extracellular environment
^1664574050854

Intracellular receptors::Within cells; Common nonpolar, lipid-soluble structure; Can cross plasma membrane (hydrophobic) to bind w/ steroid receptors, causing the receptor (not anchored to membrane) to shift from cytoplasm to binding to nucleus and DNA; Act as regulators of gene expression
^1664574050861

Cortisol::Stress hormone; Cortisone is a drug that helps w/ pain but its hydrophobic so must be given in small quantities as it does not break down in water
^1664574050867

Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their ---::precursor, cholesterol; Small and hydrophobic and can diffuse across plasma membrane into cell where they interact w/ internal receptors
^1664574050873

Estradiol and testosterone::Estradiol (estrogen) has hydroxyl group whereas testosterone has just oxygen instead; Cholesterol has hydroxyl group there (as well as a hydrocarbon tail); Different functional groups
^1664574050879

The prefix "di" indicates ---::two hydroxyl groups in hormones 
^1664574050885

Estradiol mirrors cholesterol (both have hydroxyl group) at end, whereas testosterone has ---::just oxygen at that location; Names can be indicators of structure; "ol" = hydroxyl and "one" = oxygen
^1664574050892

Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with ---::intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm
^1664574050898

Transcription factors::Many intracellular receptors interact w/ DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression as transcription factors (transcription = DNA --> mRNA); Can turn genes on and off
^1664574050904

Intercellular receptor::Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors) can bind a ligand outside the cell; Transmembrane proteins in contact w/ both cytoplasm and extracellular environment; Photons stimulate plants; Sound waves physically push wavelength-sensitive receptors to stimulate them
^1664574050911

Chemically gated ion channels::Channel-linked receptors that open to let a specific ion pass in response to a ligand; Intercellular
^1664574050917

Cells usually keep sodium outside cells via Na+K+ pump, but they also can ---::open a chemically gated ion channel to let sodium enter; Increases the resting potential of the cell
^1664574050923

Resting potential::The charge inside a cell; Common value is -60 mV; Naturally negative; When sodium enters, resting potential increases (less negative) because the ions are positive; Can depolarize cell towards zero then can hyperpolarize in opposite (positive) direction (called action potential)
^1664574050930

Action potential::When you allow Na+ ions to enter, making cell less negative/more positive, neurons will fire in response to the change in resting potential; After firing, the Na+K+ pump must remove Na+ ions to maintain normal resting potential after action potential
^1664574050936


Enzymatic receptors::Receptor is an enzyme that is activated by the ligand; Almost all are protein kinases; Intercellular
^1664574050942

G protein-coupling receptor (GPCR)::A G-protein (a protein bound to GTP) assists in transmitting the signal from receptor to enzyme (effector); Intercellular
^1664574050948


G-protein::A protein that is bound to GTP (guanine triphosphate); GPCRs use these to transmit signals from receptors to enzymes; G-protein is like a switch turned on by receptor and hydrolyzing a phosphate turns off the receptor
^1664574050954

G-proteins have the intrinsic ability to ---::hydrolize; Can turn itself off by removing the phosphate back to GDP, making it GTP again (Receptor first turned it on when GP got phosphate from GTP, making it GDP)
^1664574050961

The single largest category of receptors in animal cells are ---::GPCRs; A worm has exactly 958 cells and >5% of proteins are GPCRs in these worms; Critical for animal cells
^1664574050968

G-proteins provide links between receptor that receives signal and ---::effector protein (usually an enzyme) that produces a cellular response
^1664574050974

Gated ion channels form a ---::pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds; The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell
^1664574050981

All G-proteins are --- when bound to GTP and --- when bound to GDP::active; inactive; Receptors act by coupling w/ a g-protein providing a link between receptors and effector proteins
^1664574050988

Kinases::Enzymes that phosphorylates something; Gets phosphates from ATP or GTP
^1664574050995

Scaffold proteins::Hold map kinases (kinases that stimulate cell division); Cascades from MKKK to MKK to MK then to response proteins; Improve efficiency but reduce amplification effect; Binds to each individual kinase such that they are spatially organized for optimal function

1. Around 60,000 vs millions of invertebrates
	1. Diverse but not as diverse as invertebrates
	2. The most obvious animals that we typically see/think of
		1. Larger 
			1. Ex: Blue whale
			2. Smallest living vertebrate is a tiny fish
2. These are all under Phylum Chordata
	1. More resolved than invertebrate taxonomy but still complex
		1. Reptiles and Birds are more closely related than we once thought
	2. Jawless fishes were the first Chordates
		1. Then jawed fishes
	3. Cartledge vs bone skeletons
	4. Tetrapod evolution from fish
		1. Limbed vertebrates
		2. Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, etc.
		3. Start in aquatic than transition to terrestrial 
	5. Before vertebrates, invertebrates dominated
3. Phylogenetics
	1. Metazoa -> Bilateral -> Eucoelomates -> Deuterostomes -> Phylum Chordata 
		1. Several further classifications
4. Vertebrate Problem Set #1
	1. Problems faced by tunicates and lancelates
	2. Overcoming echinoderm & other limitations
	3. How to become larger?
	4. How to move more efficiently in water?
	5. How to collect larger food?
	6. How to transport O2 efficiently 
5. Vertebrate Problem Set #2
	1. Overcoming agnathan limitations
		1. Problems faced by hagfishes and lamprey
		2. [[Clade Agnatha]]
	2. How to subjugate larger food?
	3. How to feed on different prey?
	4. How to move more efficiently in water?
		1. Not strong swimmers
	5. Attain larger sizes?
		1. Not larger than 3 ft
	6. Expand into more varied habitats?
6. Vertebrate Problem Set #3
	1. Overcoming fish limitations
		1. [[Clade Gnathostome]] & [[Clade Osteichthyes]]
	2. How can I support and move my body?
	3. How do I extract O2 from the air?
	4. How do I more efficiently transport O2?
	5. How do I best conserve water out of water?
	6. How do I take advantage of terrestrial niches?
7. Vertebrate Problem Set #4
	1. Overcoming amphibian limitations
		1. [[Clade Tetrapod]]
	2. How do I reduce my reliance on water?
	3. How do I better support my body on land?
	4. How do I transport O2 more efficiently?
	5. How do I better extract O2 from air?
	6. How can I move faster and/or further inland?
8. Vertebrate Problem Set #5
	1. Overcoming reptilian limitations
		1. [[Clade Amniotes]]
	2. How can I insulate to change temp?
	3. How can I become less restricted by temp?
	4. How do I better utilize available resources?
	5. How do I include more of Earth as habitat?

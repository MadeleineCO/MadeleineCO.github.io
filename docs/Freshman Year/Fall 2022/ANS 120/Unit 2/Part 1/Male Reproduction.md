1. Objective is sperm production, storage, packaging into semen, and delivery to [[Female Reproduction]] systems
2. Structures
	- Testes (x2 Testicles)
		1. Must control temperature bc sperm are delicate
			- Testes further outside when warm and further inside when cold
		2. Exocrine function is production of sperm (male gamete)
			- Millions of sperm per day
			- Seminiferous tubules = location of sperm production
				- 2-3 tubules per tube
				- One bull has about 3 miles of these tubules for large production
				- Pushed to Mediastinum after production in seminiferous tubules
			- Sperm components
				1. Head = DNA
				2. Midpiece = Mitochondria for energy
				3. Principle piece for locomotion
					- Not a tail
					- Can spin like a propellor 
				5. Abnormalities
					- <10% defective sperm is considered normal production 
					- Principle piece ex: bent principle piece, multiple principle pieces, too short
					- Head ex: small, large, triangular
					- Neck and Midpiece ex: bent, thin, thick, asymmetric
		3. Endocrine function is hormone production
			- Estrogen (E2) and Testosterone (T) are primary for normal sperm production
			- Other hormones as well
	- Epididymis ("on testes") (x2)
		1. Pushed from testes to head of epididymis
		2. No endocrine function except in horses
			- Testosterone cells in testes and epididymis
		3. Like a tube or river
		4. Sperm transport from testes to caua (tail) epididymis 
		5. Nutrition for sperm (exocrine)
		6. Sperm maturation process continues
			- Can take 60 days in bulls
		7. Storage for ejaculation 
			- Caua is only place where mature sperm that can be ejaculated are stored
	- Vas Deferens (Ductus Deferens) 
		1. Transports sperm from epididymis to the urethra 
			- Or to cloaca in [[Avian]] species
	- Urethra
		1. Sperm packaging center
		2. Where urine is removed
		3. Then sperm added to accessory fluids from glands to create semen
		4. Accessory glands
			- Creates semen (sperm + accessory fluids)
			- Adds volume and some nutrients
			- Can have up to three glands (varies across species)
				1. Seminal vesicles
				2. Prostate
				3. Cowpers gland
				4. Boars have all three, Dog only has prostate, Tom has prostate and Bulbourethra
		5. Sperm goes through urethra, *not* penis
			- Urethra used for semen and urine expulsion 
	- Penis
		1. 2 primary types
			- Fibrous
				1. Lots of tunica albuginea (connective tissue)
				2. Less corpus cavernosum (spongy vascular tissue)
				3. Blood influx only increases stiffness of penis, not size (length and diameter)
				4. Has retractor muscle that relaxes to elongate
				5. Most livestock species
			- Vascular 
				1. Lots of corpus cavernosum (spongy vascular tissue)
				2. Less tunica albuginea (connective tissue)
				3. As blood flow increases, size (length and diameter) and rigidity of penis increases
				4. Stallions, humans
		2. Deposited in vagina in most species
			- Except boars
		3. Os penis
			- Bone in some species like dogs that increases rigidity
		4. Toms have a locking mechanism
3. [[Avian]] Reproductive Tract
	- Two testes
	- Modified epididymis and vas deferens
		1. No temperature control mechanism and testes inside body 
	- Sperm goes to cloaca from vas deferens and deposited to female from there
	- Sperm survival in [[Female Reproduction]] tract
		1. Mammals = 48-72 hours
		2. Chickens = 35 days
		3. Turkeys = 70 days
		4. Sperm are stored in female tract until egg goes down
			- Don't have to breed as much as other species

1. [[Female Reproduction]]
2. Ovaries
	- Two different functions
		1. Exocrine function = Production and release (ovulation) of ovum
			- Follicle grows and grows, animal goes into estrus, exocrine occurs
		2. Endocrine function = Production and release of specific hormones
			- Hormones are chemical signals that are designed to travel through circulatory system for communication (controlled by nervous system (faster) or endocrine system (slower))
			- Estrogen (E2) = "Hormone of Estrus" (Involved w/ physiological and behavior changes that prepare for sperm transport and fertilization)
				1. Prepares reproductive tract for potential gamete fertilization
				2. From follicle cells
			- Testosterone (T) = Required for ovum development
			- Corpus Luteum = "Yellow body"
				1. Develops from cells of follicle after ovulation
				2. Produces Progesterone (P4) = "Hormone of pregnancy" (Prepares reproductive track for gestation)
3. Oviduct
	- Between ovaries and uterotubial junction
	- May be called fallopian tubes
		 1. Extension of the uterine horns
	- Important for transport of both the ovum and sperm
	- Site of fertilization (combining male + female gametes (sperm + ovum))
	- Infundibulum = funnel from ovaries
	- Nutrition
		1. Oviduct fluid provides nutrients for the embryo while in transport to uterus
		2. In cows, embryo transport can take 3-5 days
4. Uterus (Horns and Body)
	- Transport
		1. In most species, sperm deposited in vagina and must get up to the oviduct
		2. Help sperm get from uterine body to oviduct by smooth muscle contractions
		3. Parturition process through smooth muscle contractions
	- Nutrition
		1. Provides embryo nutrients until placental attachment occurs
			- Called uterine milk
		2. Placental attachment = embryonic tissues to attachment uterine wall
	- Site of Gestation
		1. Involves placental attachment
	- Endocrine
		1. Produces many hormones depending on species
5. Cervix
	- Protection of the uterine environment from potential pathogens
	- Contains folds that makes it easier to get things out than in
	- Located below uterine horns
	- Opens during estrus
		1. Produces high amounts of mucus during estrus that washes out
		2. Mucus provides lubrication and flows outward to protect from microorganisms trying to enter
		3. 90% of sperm may be washed out as well, but very high amounts so plenty can still make it
	- Opens during parturition 
		1. Dilation of cervix indicates how close parturition is
6. Vagina
	- Site of semen deposition in most species
		1. Exception is swine, which deposited in uterus 
		2. Semen = sperm + accessory fluids 
	- Located under the cervix
	- Also removal of urine
	- Tough internal tissues

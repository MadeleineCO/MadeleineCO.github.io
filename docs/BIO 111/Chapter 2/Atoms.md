	B. [[Electrons]]
III. The number of protons and electrons make each [[Element]] unique
	A. Atomic number = num of protons
		- Number of protons equals number of electrons when naturally neutral
			a. Atoms are electrically neutral
			b. Every atom of a particular element has the same number of protons
	B. Atomic mass
		- Mass or weight?
			a. Mass refers to amount of substance
			b. Weight refers to force gravity exerts on substance
		- Sum of protons and neutrons is the atom's atomic mass
			a. Each proton and neutron has a mass of approximately 1 dalton
		- Listed on the periodic table
			a. Atomic mass (rounded to whole number) can tell you the number of protons and neutrons together
				i. Atomic mass - Atomic number = number of neutrons

Over 500 varieties of ---::cheese; Depends on type of bacteria added
^1665534088327

Cheese production starts w/ milk (sometimes pasteurized and sometimes not) then a ---::coagulation agent (usually rennet (enzyme from cow abomasum for milk coagulation)) then add microorganism and take solids (w/ salt added), form a shape (block, circle, etc.) and let age
^1665534088333

Aging Cheese::The longer the aging process, the stronger the taste; Some not very aged at all (ex cottage cheese); Most 1-3 years but some aged for 12+ years

America's cheeses::Mozzarella is most popular, then cheddar; Cheese consumption is going up in US but low compared to other countries
^1665534088390

2x as much cheese per lb. of --- milk vs --- milk::sheep; cow; Sheep's milk costs 4x vs cow milk
^1665534088398

Butter production::raw milk turned into pasteurized cream that ripens (ages) then butterfat crystalizes then butter granules form; Butter can then be used as raw butter or put in butter milk (Raw butter --> finished butter)
^1665534088405

^1665534088456

Compounds that can be absorbed in milk ---::influence flavor; Correlated to energy requirements (Fat is high in energy and good for newborns)
^1665534088462

Dairy Cows::5 major breeds (Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Holstein, Jersey); >90% fluid milk comes from cattle (Pounds not Gallons)
^1665534088468

Jersey::Isle of Jersey; 15,000 lbs. of milk and 5% fat; Jerseys are second to Holsteins (>8%)
^1665534088498

Holstein produces 10,000 more lbs. of milk than Jerseys. Holstein has 3.5% fat while Jersey has 5% fat, but 25,000/3.5% is 875 lbs for H while 15,000/5% is 750 lbs. of fat for J. This means that Holsteins produce ---::more lbs. of milk and more fat in total for farms. A producer is paid based of lbs. of milk, lbs. of fat, and protein content.
^1665534088505

Agriculture Cooperative (Ag Co-ops)::Legalized Monopolies control production, processing, and distribution; Western, S Central, W NC, E NC, S Atlantic, and N Atlantic; Must be part of Ag Co-Op to sell milk for commercial purposes (must buy shares and can sell up to the num of shares you have)
^1665534088512

Milk Grades::Based on Somatic cell count (SCC) and bacteria level; Grade A - Can be used for any dairy product; Grade B - Only used for processed products (not fluid milk)
^1665534088518

Grades are based on ---::quality and sanitation parameters; If SCC count is elevated, likely an infection and bacteria level is an indirect measure of cow health and quality
^1665534088524

Grade A::Can be used for any dairy product; <100,000/ml of bacteria and <750,000/ml of somatic cells; >90% of all dairies produces this fluid or "manufacturing" 
^1665534088530

Grade B::Only used for processed products (Not fluid milk); >1,000,000/ml of bacteria and <1,000,000/ml of SCC; Classes (Fluid milk, Soft products, Cheese, Butter)
^1665534088535

South has greater num of ---::sick cows because hot+humid so more parasites and more difficulty to keep cows healthy; May hurt grades
^1665534088542

Pasteurization::Purpose is to destroy potential pathogens in milk; Flash heating (160 degrees F for 30 sec); Destroys bacteria, viral agents, protozoa, hormones; Done via a water bath
^1665534088548

Homogenization::Fat layer forms as it separates unless milk is homogenized; Homogenization is the process of breaking fat molecules into microscopic pieces (takes much longer to coagulate)
^1665534088554

Milk Composition::Water (87%), Lactose (5%), Fat (3.5%), Casein (protein) (2.8%), Minerals (Ca and P) (0.7%), Albumin (protein) (0.5%); Everything necessary for offspring to grow
^1665534088560

Lactation Physiology::Udder (where mammary glands are connected together by connective tissue); Each are individual units; Mammary glands (milk producing organs)
^1665534088570

Mammary glands tend to come in --- numbers and typically have --- the num of glands for the avg of offspring::even; twice
^1665534088576

The greater the pounds of milk production, the ---::lower percentage fat content per pound
^1665534088583

Dry Lot::Management system = providing all forage for cows (supplement feed w/ alfalfa); Big western farms; Dry lot = where animal goes for parturition (all dairies have these)
^1665536085886

Hypocalcium::Where too much of cow's calcium is yanked from muscles to milk before parturition; Must make sure pregnant cows get plenty of calcium bc they are producing so much milk; Occurs almost exclusively in dairy animals
^1665536085894

Colostrum::Cow's first milk; Produced for very young calves and high in nutrients such as lactose and protein; Also provides antibodies to young calves (don't have working immune system during 1st 36 hours)
^1665536085899

Dairy farmers isolate calves from birth and distribute ---::colostrum; There is also artificial colostrum but better from mother bc of regional antibodies; Isolate calves to decrease exposure to disease
^1665536085905

Young calves have their ---::horn buds removed and vaccines; The males are slaughtered bc we mostly use AI
^1665536085911


Milking process::Pre-dip (exfoliant; makes teat softer), Forestrip (2-3 strips to check for abnormal milk), Dry, Attach unit, Adjust unit, Remove unit before milk flow stops; Detach unit gently after turning vacuum off, Post-dip (protective layer against antigens)
^1665536085916

CMT::California Mastitis Test; Checks the Somatic Cell Count in dairy cows; The more gelling, the greater the SCC; Mild is 400,000 to 1,200.000. Very mild is 200,000 to 400,000. Moderate is 1.200,000 to 5,000,000. Heavy gelling indicates >5,000,000; All antibiotic residues must be completely removed
^1665536085922

For a cow to release milk, she must be ---::stimulated; Can be through sound of milking machine, the sight of a calf, and/or touch of the udder's skin
^1665536085927

A vacuum holds the milking machine ---::onto the teats while the short pulse tubes stimulates mimics a milking calf
^1665536085933

A dairy storage unit is ---::pneumatically driven and remains cold to slow bacterial growth; Agitator periodically stirs milk to keep fat from solidifying 
^1665536085939

Desirable dairy cow qualities::Feminine head (more estrogen = more milk); Bigger breast (can eat more); Uniform teats (to fit machine); Skinner cow (means using nutrients to produce more milk), Larger udder, Definite cleavage between mammary glands (Obvious left/right indicates that mammary glands is held on better)
^1665536085945

[[2022-10-13]]
Udder::Where mammary glands are connected together by connective tissue; Each are individual units
^1665682363857

Mammary Glands::Milk producing organs; Cows have 4; Tend to be in even numbers and typically have twice the num of mammary glands for the avg of offspring
^1665682363865

Alveolus::Milk synthesizing units; Millions of them in the mammary glands; Can each produce about 1/5 of a drop; Take nutrients and put them in milk
^1665682363872

Myoepithelial cells::Surround the alveolus; Individual smooth muscle cells (can contract); If stimulated, cells contract and milk is pushed down into milk ducts
^1665682363880

Milk ducts::Small collecting ducts and Large collecting ducts; When myoepithelial contracts, the milk is let down into these ducts
^1665682363887

Gland cistern::2 lbs. capacity; Hold milk after let-down has been stimulated
^1665682363896

Teat cistern::Can hold about a mouthful of milk; Like a funnel after the gland cistern to the Furstenberg's rosette
^1665682363904

Furstenberg's Rosette::One way valve; Allows milk to come out but blocks stuff from coming in; Stays open while milking; Post dip protects things from getting in the valve right after milking; Right before streak canal
^1665682363911

Streak canal::Opening at very end of teat
^1665682363919

Milk Let Down::Stimuli releases hormone oxytocin, which causes contraction of myoepithelial cells to force milk into collecting ducts; Stimuli can include familiar smells, people, sound of milking machine, sight of calf, etc.
^1665682363927

400 gallons of blood circulation is required to provide ---::nutrients for 1 gallon of milk
^1665682363933

Once the mammary gland is full, the cow ---::stops producing milk; Rate of milk synthesis decreases w/ time post-milking
^1665682363941

Lots of milk made right after milking, but around ---, production stops and mammary glands are full::six hours; Milking every six hours maximizes overall production; Most dairies now milk three times a day instead of just two
^1665682363949

Intramammary pressure controls ---::milk production; Neural system; More pressure = decreased milk synthesis and vise versa
^1665682363955

Lactation Cycles::Milk production is usually the highest at early lactation (when offspring needs most milk); As more time passes and offspring grows, milk production decreases
^1665682363962

Holstein lactation cycle::Post-calving, produces about 50 lb/day initially. Rapidly increases to max of 75 lb/day. Then decreases over the course of 44 weeks to about 25 lb/day; Meet breeds show dramatic difference from Holstein
^1665682363969

Horses::Some good horses can produce as much milk as a lesser dairy cow, but horses have much smaller udders; Foals nurse more frequently, decreasing intramammary pressure and increasing frequency of milk synthesis
^1665682363976

Calving interval::Time between one offspring and the next; Most dairies do 13-14 month calving intervals instead of 12-month now (more money return required to meet cost; makes more sense from high production level)
^1665682363984

Twelve month calving interval::Day 0 = calving, Day 80 = breeding, Day 305 = drying, Day 365 = calving
^1665682363991

 Drying::Discontinuing milk removal so nutrients are eventually reabsorbed and udder can repair itself; Udder insulation (Repair mammary glands for next lactation cycle)
^1665682363998

Thirteen month calving interval::Day 0 = calving, Day 110 = breeding, Day 335 = drying, Day 395 = calving
^1665682388743

Fourteen month calving interval::Day 0 = calving, Day 140 = breeding, Day 365 = drying, Day 425 = calving
^1665682388751

Milking process (ans)::Entry into parlor/barn, Pre-dipping (sanatize teat), Fore-stripping (check for abnormal milk), Drying, Attach unit, Detach unit, Post-dipping (decreases chance of infection from bacterial entry via Furstenberg's Rosette)
^1665682410171

Milking parlors are designed to optimize ---::speed of the process; Four major styles (Bali, Swingover, Herringbone, Rotary)
^1665682364011

Dairy production has increased in efficiency due to ---::genetic selection; Producing much more milk than cows would normally need; Genetic selection and use of AI based on sire
^1665682364018

Sire Summary::Estimate of genetic value presented as effects on production; Indication of daughter's potential performance based off genetic estimates; Can freeze semen and ship for AI
^1665682364026

If 1805 lbs. listed on a sire summary, then we expect daughters to ---::have 1805 more lbs. of milk per lactation compared to the avg of the breed (heterosis)
^1665682364033

If 71% fat listed, then we expect the daughters to ---::produce 71% more pounds of fat per lactation compared to the avg of the breed
^1666290094310

What info do you need to know to determine the actual effect on breeding (AI) compared to your herd?::The avg of the breed for that trait and your herd avg for that trait; Must make a comparison
^1666290094321

Comparing your herd to breed ex::Breed avg = 20,000 lbs. per lactation; Your herd avg = 25,000 lbs. per lactation; Daughters of sire expected to produce 1,805 more lbs. of milk per lactation compared to avg of breed; Getting this breed of cow would lower your production even if daughters expected to produce 1,805 more lbs. bc that wouldn't make up the difference; Breed avgs change so must always check
^1666290094329

The dairy industry wants more ---::heifers for milk production bc AI is used for breeding; Sexing semen allows us to select more females
^1666290094337

Sexing semen::A sperm has either an X or Y chromosome; X sperm should have more volume in head (bigger head and more negative); Y sperm has slightly smaller head (and less negative) and are faster bc they are smaller; You can sort based on electric charge and speed
^1666290094344

To sex semen, you can ---::set up two plates (on pos and one neg) then let sperm fall and they should sort themselves by repulsion or attraction
^1666290094352

bST (bovine Sematotrophin)::Used to be called bGH (bovine Growth Hormone); somatotrophin = stimulating cells; Major regulator of milk production and naturally occurring hormone that has big impact on production
^1666290094360

bST effects include ---::6-8% increase in feed intake and 10-20% milk production; Allows for smaller but more efficient herd; Increases metabolic rate and lipolysis (fat breakdown so nutrients more quickly available) 
^1666290094367

bST causes no detectable difference in ---::milk composition; May not be great for cow (may push animals beyond ideal) but not harmful to people; Social pressure drove bST away
^1666290094374

Ultimate success of dairy industry due to ---::Dairy Herd Improvement Association (record system; kept avg of breeds); Limited num of traits selected (many positively related); Adaption of technology (AI, Environment control to max production through health programs, nutrition, facilities, equipment, etc.)
^1666290094381

[[2022-10-23]]
Cattle Parturition::Calving
^1666550645779

Cattle Intact male::Bull

^1666550645817

Cattle Young male::Bull colf/Bullock
^1666550645825

Cattle Young female::Heifer
^1666550645833

Cattle All young::Calves
^1666550645841

Great Aurock::Original ancestor of cattle; Intentional demostication; Used intentional selection to create domesticated cattle breeds
^1666550645849

Robert Bakewell::Breed development from 1725-1795; Point where selective breeding began; Developed shire/draft horse; Dishley Longhorn
^1666550645859

Creating breeds requires ---::recordkeeping, evaluation of offspring for selection of next generation, inbreeding, and selecting traits of interest
^1666550645866

Synthetics::Breeds created from cross breeding other breeds; Ex: Santa Gertrudis = 5/8 shorthorn and 3/8 brahman
^1666550645875

Purebred::Defined set of characteristics of an animal that are passed from parent to offspring; 250 breeds recognized but >300 varieties and types not given "names"; We decide the characteristics of what counts as a certain breed; Genetically, tend to be more homozygous
^1666550645883

There are two major species of ---::beef cattle (taurus and indicus); bos indicates genus (bovine)
^1666550645890

European (bos taurus)::Moderately sized (1000-1500 lbs.); Ex: Angus, Hereford, Shorthorn
^1666550645898

European beef cattle characteristics::Carcass quality (Amount of meat and quality of meat), Maternal ability (Care for offspring including milk production), Reproduction (Ability to reproduce without major issues), Sows (Milk production for human use)
^1666550645906

Continental (bos taurus)::Large breed; Used for meat, milk, and draft; Similar characteristics as Europeans but also used for draft
^1666550645915

Zebu (bos indicus)::Commonly known as humped cattle; Used for meat (although lower quality and quantity than European and Continental); Milk and draft; Subtropical + tropical climates (shiny hair to reflect sun, more hair fibers for increased surface area for sweating, increase in body surface area for cooling, large ears, more disease/parasite resistant); Ex: Brahman
^1666550645922

Synthetic breeds were developed by ---::crossing established breeds until a point is reached of being a purebred; Ex: Brangus = angus + brahman; Simbrah = brahman + shorthorn
^1666550645931

Why have so many beef breeds?::With beef, we are trying to find animals that are best suited to natural environments (w/ dairy, only 5 major breeds bc we alter environmental conditions for animal)
^1666550645938

Cattle nums increased until about 1972, then ---::dropped; Used to go through waves of increasing and decreasing nums (trying to meet demand)
^1666550645946

Cattle is centralized in the Midwest bc ---::land is not available for other uses such as crops; Top states = Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, California, Oklahoma, Missouri; Infrastructure mostly in midwest as well
^1666550645953

Infrastructure::Levels of segments of an industry; Purebreeders --> Cow/Calf --> Stocker --> Feedlot --> Packers
^1666550645961

Purebreeders (Seedstock)::Provide bulls for genetic base to sell to cow/calf operations; Specialized cow-calf producers that provide genetic material to beef supply chain
^1666741379764

Why do we look at bull genetics over cow?::One bull can breed many cows (30-50) whereas a cow has much fewer offspring so easier to perpetuate bull genetics
^1666741379774

Almost all of AI use occurs in --- operations::purebreeder; Not practical outside of these purebred herds; Barely occurs in beef cattle overall; Embryo splitting or transfer used even less overall
^1666741379781

A small portion of purebreeders provide --- breeds::novelty; Ex: Scottish Highlander, Minis, Texas Longhorn, Ankole-Watusi; Mostly for fun bc doesn't fit normal beef production (most looking for enhancing production)
^1666741379788

Commercial Cow-Calf::Produce one weaned calf every 365 days; Largest infrastructure group; Calving interval = 12 months; Two major groups (meat production and replacement heifers)
^1666741379796

Weaning::Separation of dam from offspring; Occurs at about 5-7 months and weigh around 400-600 lbs; During cow-calf
^1666741379804

The meat production cow-calf group includes --- while the replacement group includes ---::all steers + about 60% of heifers; 40% of heifers to start w/
^1666741379811

Extensive crossbreeding is used in the ---::beef industry; >80% crossbred to increase heterosis; Traits such as weaning weight, maternal ability, and reproductive function respond to crossbreeding while other traits (such as carcass or meat characteristics) do *not* demonstrate heterosis
^1666741379819

Heterosis (ans)::Average of the crossbred offspring are higher/superior in given *traits* compared to the average performance of the parental breeds; Due to increased heterozygosity; Only certain traits respond to this
^1666741412772

Carcass quality meets in the middle between ---::parents (not heterosis) while other traits such as reproduction and calf survivability do demonstrate heterosis
^1666741379827

Two breed rotation::Pasture one starts w/ Breed A. Pasture 2 starts w/ Breed B. Rotate female offspring to other pasture. Then rotate those female offspring. Then rotate next female offspring. Etc; 15% increase in repro rate
^1666741379836

Three breed rotation::Pasture one starts w/ Breed A. Pasture 2 starts w/ Breed B. Pasture 2 starts w/ Breed B. Pasture 3 starts w/ Breed C. Rotate female offspring; 23% increase in weaning weight per cow exposed to bull (more heterosis than 2b rotation bc greater genetic diversity)
^1666741379844

Four breed rotation::Increases weaning weight per cow exposed by 24%; Increase in heterosis rate starts to slow bc there can only be so much heterozygosity at an allele level; Maximal heterozygosity of alleles in genes about reached by 3 breed rotation
^1666741379851

Why is it so difficult to produce a weaned calf each 365 days (cow-calf industry)::365 days - 285 gestation = 80 days to rebreed; 35-40 of those days require uterine involution (repair of uterus for next gestation) and 60 days of lactational anestrous (milk synthesis interferes w/ resumption of normal estrous cycles); Leaves only 20 days to rebreed (estrous cycle is 21 so only one chance for conception); Many things could go wrong and hurt chances further
^1666741379858

Stocker::In-between weaned calf but before animal goes to feedlot; Between 400-600 lbs. weaning weight and 800-900 lbs. for feedlot; Between 5-7m and 9-11m; Allows for natural maturation; Forage for 4-7m w/ low energy ration on pasture grass and crop residue
^1666741379867

Feedlot::Weight 800-900 lbs. and are about 8-10m; Very yew countries can afford feedlots; Take from stocker operation and hold for 2-3m; Objectives are to increase intramuscular fat (marbling) and influence taste/color of fat (eat whole corn plants for white, less "gamey" tasting fat)
^1666741379874

The goal of feedlot is *not* to ---::make cows fatter; Want to increase *intramuscular* fat, taste of fat, and color of fat
^1666741379882

When an intensely cold iron is used in freeze branding, the cold temp destroys the ---::color follicles at the brand site so that the hair contains no pigment; If brand held on longer, it destroys growth follicles as well so that no hair grows at all

Freeze branding requires ---::99.9% alcohol (water would cause ice layer to form), stopwatch (we held iron on for 1 min), electronic clipper (shave hair before branding), and dry ice

Ear tags::Pros = Easy administration, readability = can easily be seen by person; Cons = Not a permanent form of identification, can readily fall out  
  
Neck Chains::Pros – Easy administration, readability; Cons = Not a permanent form of identification, can come off, poses a high potential risk for the animal if it becomes stuck on an object. Used on some dairies.  

Tattoo::Pros = Permanent identification; Cons = Typically in the ear or upper lip, typically requires physical restraint to read and cannot be observed from a distance.  
  
EID::Electronic Identification Devices = (Vary in complexity)

Electronic bracelets::(ex. Berry Dairy) = Typically attached as a leg band or on a neck  
chain; Pros = Relatively inexpensive, useful for dairy or animals where reading Id is  
automatic, such as in the milking parlor; Cons = Not a permanent form of identification, can fall off or be a safety risk.  
  
RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Device)::Microchip = imbedded subcutaneous  
^1666894796001
or as a part of ear implant; Pros = Cannot fall off if imbedded; Cons = Not a permanent form of identification in cattle, RFID failure rate can be moderate, must be restrained to read, no readability  

Paint Branding::Application of a temporary non-toxic paint. Often used at livestock auctions; Pros – Readability, cost; Cons – Short term (<14-days). Not a permanent form of identification.  
  
Hot Branding::Causes permanent scarring of the hide (skin surface). In some states, this is the primary form of identification for ownership purposes; Pros = Permanent form of identification, high readability; Cons = Degree of animal pain involved in initial application.  
  
Caustic Branding::Use of strong acids or bases to cause permanent scarring of the hide (skin surface). Rarely if ever used; Pros = Permanent form of identification, high readability; Cons = Degree of animal pain involved in initial application, highly dangerous to humans involved in application of materials.  
  
Freeze Branding objective is ---::destroy the cells that produce pigmentation, but not kill  
other components related to the hair follicle. If done correctly, no damage is done to skin surface and hair grows back without any pigmentation (white); Pros = Permanent form of identification in some states, high readability, limited pain during administration; Cons = Not a permanent form of identification in some states, high failure rate if procedures not followed accurately, is not effective on cattle with white hair or lacking pigmentation.  
  
Hypodermic Administration of Compounds::Most compounds requiring hypodermic administered to cattle are delivered subcutaneously or intramuscular; Administration location – In most cases, hypodermic delivery by subcutaneous or intramuscular administration are completed in the neck region to avoid any potential muscle damage or scarring to muscle used for human consumption.  
  
Paraside Administration::Delivery of paraside are typically administered by hypodermic administration or pouring the material on the skin surface for absorption

What is an EPD?::Expected Progeny Difference or Expected Predicted Difference; The expectation of performance in a given trait in the offspring of the sire compared to the average of the breed. 

What is meant by accuracy (ACC) of the EPD?::Accuracy is the degree of reliability of the EPD; The higher the accuracy the less deviation expected in the actual EPD expressed; Based upon the level of information available about the sires genetic potential  
(individual, pedigree, sibs, progeny); As more information is available, the higher the accuracy

What is the interpretation for an EPD of Birth Weight?::Ex: The offspring of the sire would expected to be 2.7 lbs. heavier at birth compared to the average of the breed; Similar for interpretation for an EPD of weaning weight and of yearling weight

How is maternal ability in beef cattle measured if actual milk production is not measured?::Maternal ability is estimated as the proportion of weaning weight that can be attributed to milk production of the dam; Ex: the female offspring are expected to contribute 9.2 lbs. toward weaning weight as a function of milk production.

EPD’s are estimates of ---::offspring performance of a given sire based  
upon the average of the breed  

Accuracy of an EPD increases as ---::more information of performance are available  

Moderation in change is typically more effective than ----::making large  
changes when breeding

If you have limited feed resources, a cow that is predicted to have a higher maternal ability may not help bc ---::you don't have enough feed resources to support her reach her full milk production potential; Must consider effect of your resources when looking at sire summaries and potential performance of daughters; If you have ample feed resources, then you could support a cow w/ higher maternal ability so might be beneficial

When looking at sire summaries, you want the daughters to have low or negative ---::EPD of birth weight; Bigger calf may lead to dystocia 

DTS on sire summaries indicates::number of daughters; The more daughters (higher DTS), the more info about a sire and therefore the higher ACC of maternal ability (milk production)

[[2022-10-27]]
Grain finished sum::14-16m old; Pasture range = 9-12m; Feedlot = 50-120d; Fed whole corn plants; Fat color = white; Fat content = high (grade dependent); Connective tissue = lower (more tender; aged <72 hrs); Lower carbon footprint
^1666906652223

Grass finished sum::>2yr old (3-5 is common); Pasture/range only; Fat color = yellow/orange; Fat content = varies; Connective tissue = increases (less tender; aged up to 20d); Higher carbon footprint
^1666906652232

Packers::Disassembly plant after feedlot; Taking --> slaughter process --> processing (breaking down into meat and side product)
^1666906652239

Four companies process over ---::80% of all beef produced; 35 mil head of cattle annually
^1666906652246

During the packer operation, animals go through the ---::slaughter process where animals rendered unconscious; Then skinning and blood draining; Then age in cooler around 72hrs 
^1666906652253

Boxed beef vs sides of carcasses::Boxed beef has specific cuts in each box (easier for transport + storage; encourages uniformity of animal that meets needs of consumer); Side of carcass method involves sending carcasses to local butchers who then cut meat (more difficult for transport)
^1666906652259

Products made from cattle::Utilize 99.7% of animal; Many cuts of meat; Ex: cosmetics, explosives, drywall, fertilizer, brake fluid, adhesives, plastics ; medical materials; leather, textiles, etc.
^1666906652266

Grading slaughter cattle carcasses; quality grade (prediction of palatability) and yield grade (proportion of primary retail cuts of meat compared to carcass); Inverse relationship (as one gets more favorable, other gets less favorable)

Quality grade takes into account the ---::age of animal at processing (younger should taste better and have less connective tissue) and intramuscular fat (fat within/between muscle fibers; more marbling is better)
^1666906652273

Any animal under 42 months of age is ---::high quality grade; Most animals in A category (about 12-16 months)
^1666906652280

Prime quality grade::Young w/ lots of intramuscular fat; Very expensive bc it takes lot more feed
^1666906652287

Choice quality grade::Young w/ moderate intramuscular fat; Most common
^1666906652294

Select quality grade::Young w/ some intramuscular fat; Lower quality than choice or prime
^1666906652301

Yield grade::Proportion of primary retail cuts of meat compared to carcass; Live animal --> removal of internal organs, skin, head, and feet --> carcass; Proportion of major meat cutts compared to carcass (amount of primary meat cuts from carcass); Parts of carcass not used for major meat cuts still used for other purposes
^1666906652307

Yield grade is on a scale of ---::1-5 w/ one being more product per carcass (less fat) and five being less product per carcass (more excess back fat); We trim fat off edge so five involves most trimming and one involves least amount of trimming
^1666906652314

If we increase quality grade, we tend to have ---::less favorable field grade; Prime has more excess back fat and therefore is higher on yield grade scale (worse yield); Optimal is choice quality and around 2-2.5 yield
^1666906652320

Wagyu cattle::Extreme marbling (intramuscular fat); National treasure in Japan; Super expensive; Japan does not have much grain but feed cattle socky (alcohol)
^1666906652327

Cattle repro::estrous cycle = 21 days; Estrus = 12 hours; Gestation = 285 days; Nonseasonal (polyestrous; can have estrous cycles year-round)
^1666906652333

Cattle breeding cycle::Either spring calving or fall calving (uniform groups); Spring calving (day 0 = breeding in april/may/june, Day 285 = calving in feb, march, april, Day 365 = breeding in april/may/june)
^1666906652340

[[2022-10-30]]
When on spring calving schedule, spring work occurs after ---::calving; 6-8 weeks of branding, dehorning, castration, and vaccinations
^1667159154678

When on spring calving schedule, fall work occurs around ---::september; Includes weaning (when calves about 5-7 months old and 400-600 pounds) and pregnancy check for cows
^1667159154685

After weaning in the cow/calf operation, 40% of heifers are --- and 100% of steers and 60% of heifers are ---::kept as replacement breeders; sold to stocker industry; Weaning occurs in the fall when on spring calving schedule
^1667159154691

After keeping 40% of heifers, cow/calf operations cull ---::10-15% of the cows they are replacing
^1667159154698

Heifer breeding season starts when heifers are ---::13 months old; Heifers breed one month before cow herd (march for spring cycle) bc virgin heifers are easiest to breed but have highest rate of dystocia; Gives extra month to focus on them calving and more recovery time (uterine involution + lactation anestrous) before being rebred in cow herd
^1667159154705

The steers and 60% of heifers from cow/calf operation move on to the --- industry::stocker; Spend sept through march w/ stocker until 750-850 lbs. before going to feed lot (march through june; 1150-1200 lbs.) then packer (age 14-16 months) then retail
^1667159154713

Cows are non-seasonal --- but we want uniformaty::polyestrous (estrous cycles year-round); Choose either spring calving or fall calving
^1667159154719

Pros/Cons of spring calving::Pros = weather, nutrition (forages start growing in spring); Cons = More supply bc spring is ideal for weather and nutrition (causes value to go down)
^1667159154725

Pros/Cons of fall calving::Pros = greater value bc less supply and more demand, can be done in South (most operations still choose spring calving); Cons = Weather is usually worse, Forage is not growing (nutrition downside, we have to feed more, which costs more)
^1667159154732

Heterosis (anss)::When average of crossbred offspring is a given trait is higher/superior than the average of the parental breeds; Caused by increased heterozygosity

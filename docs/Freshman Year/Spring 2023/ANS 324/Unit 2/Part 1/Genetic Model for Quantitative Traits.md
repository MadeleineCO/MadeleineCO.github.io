1. Simply Inherited Traits = Traits affected by one or few genes 
	1. Ex: coat color, presence of horns, genetic defects such as spider syndrome in sheep
	2. Phenotypes of simply inherited traits are placed into categories
		1. Qualitative or categorical traits
	3. Environmental factors have little effect on the trait
2. Polygenic Traits = Traits affected by many genes
	1. No single gene has an overriding effect
	3. Generally described in numbers over a range of values
	4. Typically quantitative or continuous in their expression
		1. An exception to this is dystocia, which is affected by many genes but phenotype is described in categories
	5. Polygenic traits are affected by the environment
	6. Beef polygenic traits 
		1. Growth traits
			1. Birth weight, weaning weight, yearling weight, average daily gains)
		2. Carcass yield 
			1. Merit
			2. IMF = intramuscular fat, fat thickness, rib-eye area), 
		3. Reproductive traits 
			1. Semen production/scrotum circumference (bigger also means younger puberty)
			2. Heifer pregnancy (pregnant between 12 and 15 months so she can have first calf at 2 yrs)
			3. First service conception (pregnant on the first service, not repeated AI services))
			4. Rebreeding rate
			5. Stayabilitiy (cow is able to produce a calf every year for three years)
	7. Dairy polygenic traits 
		1. Milk yield
			1. Volume and persistence
		2. Milk components
			1. % fat and % protein
		3. Type traits
			1. Udder depth, stature, angularity, teat length 
		4. Reproductive traits 
			1. Heifer pregnancy 
			2. First service conception (FSC)
			3. Days open
				1. Should be less than 90 days 
				2. If greater than 90 days, cow won't have one calf per year 
3. The Basic Model for Quantitative Traits
	1. P = u + G + E
		1. u = mew
			1. The population mean or avg phenotypic value for the trait of all animals in the population
			2. Allows you to compare to the avg of the pop
		2. P = phenotypic value of an animal for a given trait
		3. G = genotypic value of the animal for the trait
			1. Genotypic value is the overall effect of all genes carried by the animal (singly and in combination)
			2. Unlike the P value, G is not directly measurable
			3. The genotypic value is the sum of two values: breeding value (BV) and gene combination value (GCV)
				1. G = BV + GCV
			4. Breeding Value = The part of the genotypic value that can be transmitted from parent to offspring
				1. Sum of effects of individual genes (called independent gene effects or additive gene effects) independent of the effects of dominance and epistasis
				2. AKA additive genetic value
				3. Before we select animals to be parents of the next generation, we first estimate their breeding values and choose those w/ the best breeding values
		4. E = effect of environmental factors on the phenotype of the animal
		5. G and E are expressed as deviations from the mean of the pop
			1. Therefore, the mean of G in the pop and the mean of E should equal zero
	2. Example: Assume that a trait is affected by 5 loci and the independent (additive) gene effects for the 10 genes (alleles) at the 5 loci are given in the table. The BV is the sum of these effects.
		1. Locus = 1   |  Allele 1 (avg effect) = +3.0  | Allele 2 (avg effect) = -0.6 | Sum = +2.4
		2.  2                |   +0.2                                    |  +4.2                                  |  +4.4
		4.  3                |   -1.4                                     |   -2.3                                  |  -3.7
		5.  4                |   +0.4                                    |   -0.1                                  |  +0.3
		6.  5                |   +0.9                                    |   +1.5                                 |  +2.4
		7.                                                                                       BBreeding Value:  +5.8
		8. Breeding value is estimated from multiple gene values 
		9. If heifer pregnancy is controlled by 3,000 genes, then you have to calculate the total breeding value for each cow from the alleles 
	3. An individual only transmits a sample composed of half its genes to each of its offspring
		1. This half is a random half of its genes
		2. Progeny difference (PD) or transmitting ability (TA) are used in practice by many countries to rank animals 
			1. Estimated progeny difference (EPD)
				1. Produced for meat animals 
					1. Beef cattle, swine, and sheep breeding
				2. If weaning weight in a EPD is listed as +2.0, then they offspring of the bull will likely weigh 2 lbs more than the average of the breed
				3. The predicted value for PD is called EPD (expected progeny difference)
			2. TA used in dairy cattle breeding
				1. The predicted value for TA is called PTA (predicted transmitting ability)
			3. Progeny difference and transmitting ability are practical concepts 
				1. Defined as the expected difference between the mean performance of the progeny of a parent and the mean performance of the progeny of all parents in the population
			4. PD = TA = 1/2 BV
			5. PDi = TAi = u (offspring of parent i) - u (offspring of all animals)
			6. PD and TA are not directly measurable but can be predicted using performance data
		3. The breeding value of an offspring can be viewed as the sum of the additive effects of the genes inherited from the sire and the additive effects of the genes inherited from the dam
			1. BV (offspring) = (BV (sire) + BV (dam)) / 2
			2. Ex: If estimated BV of a sire for weaning wgt is +1.5 kg then the avg of the expected BV of their offspring is equal to (2.5 + 1.5)/2 = +2 kg
				1. We expect the avg of the offspring of these sire and dam to be 2 kg heavier at weaning than the avg of all offspring in the population 
				2. P = u + BV (offspring)
				3. If the pop mean of weaning wgt is 18 kg, then the avg phenotype of the offspring of these sire and dam is 18 + 2 = 20 kg
4. Gene Combination Value (GCV)
	1. GCV is part of the genotypic value that is due to gene combination effects (dominance and epistasis)
	2. Bc individual genes and not gene combinations survive segregation and independent assortment during meiosis, GCV can *not* be transmitted from parent to offspring
		1. Not important in selection 
	3. Ex: Suppose that a locus affects litter size in swine w/ two alleles T and t, and T is completely dominant over t. The independent effects are +0.1 pigs for T and -0.1 pigs for t
		1. Genotype = TT | BV = 0.2   | G = 0.2   | GCV = 0
		2. Tt                      | BV = 0      | 0.2          | 0.2
		3. tt                       | BV = -0.2  | 0.2         | 0
		4. BV + G = GVC
5. Producing Ability (PA)
	1. For repeated traits (traits for which an animal have more than one performance record during its lifetime), the PA is very important
		1. Trait that can be measured multiple times during the life of an animal
		2. Ex: milk yield may be measured twice a day for years for every animal
			1. Egg yield, daily gain, wool production
	2. PA represents the performance potential of an animal for a repeated trait (the ability of the animal to repeat its performance of all those factors which permanently affect the performance potential of the animal)
		1. PA is a function of all these factors, which permanently affect the performance potential of the animal
	3. The GV and its components (BV and GCV) are determined at conception and remain w/ the animal during its whole life
		1. Some env factors may permanently affect the performance of the animal
	4. Examples of permanent environmental effects (Ep)
		1. Nutrition at early stages of development affects the ability of beef and dairy cows to produce milk permanently
		2. A permanent problem in the udder will affect milk production throughout the productive life of the cow or ewe
	5. The environmental effects that do not affect performance permanently are called temporary environmental effects (Et)
		1. Ex: forage quality, weather conditions, and some management practices
		2. Vary from season to season or year to year
		3. Do not influence different records in the same way
	6. The genetic model for repeated traits is. . .
		1. P = u + BV + GCV + Ep + Et
			1. Expanded form of P = u + G + E
	7. The PA is a combination of genetic and permanent env effects
		1. PA = G + Ep -> PA = BV + GCV + Ep
		2. The avg of PA is 0 across the population bc it is expressed as a deviation from the mean
	8. Ex: 
		1. Cow 1
			1. Record 1 | u = 18000 | BV = +1500 | GCV = -1000 | Ep = +2500 | Et = +3000 | P = 24000
			3. Record 2 | 18000        | BV = +1500 | -1000            | +2500      | -1000             | P = 20000
		2. Cow 2
			1. Record 1 | u = 18000 | BV = +1000 | GCV = -+500 | Ep = +4500 | Et = +5000 | P = 20000
			2. Record 2 | 18000        | BV = +1000 | +500            | +4500      | -2000             | P = 13000
		3. PA for cow 1 = 1500 - 1000 + 2500 = 3000 lb
		4. PA for cow 2 = 1000 + 500 - 4500 = -3000 lb
		5. If we were to cull one of these cows, we would cull cow 2
6. Importance of producing ability
	1. It is important to commercial producers as a measure of productive capacity
		1. Typically, dairy farmers feed their cows according to their producing ability
		2. Prediction of PA is quite useful in practice
	2. The predicted value of PA is called Most Probable Producing ability (MPPA)
		1. P = u + MPPA is a prediction of the animal's next record

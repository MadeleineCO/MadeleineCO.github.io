When the pink chemical in the agar blocks, phenolphthalein, is exposed to hydrochloric acid, it turns --- as the acid ---::clear; diffuses into the agar cube
^1663177404543

Volume formula::V = lwh
^1663177404552

Surface area formula::SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
^1663177404558

As cell size increases, the surface area to volume ratio::decreases; The surfaces area cannot keep up w/ the volume, consequently limiting cells to a small size
^1663177404563

As cell size increases, diffusion into the cell takes::longer; Bigger agar cubes took longer to turn clear and get exposed to hydrochloric acid

The first cell tube contained ---, the second ---, the third ---, and the fourth ---::starch; NaCl, dextrose (glucose); water
^1663177404576

The 1st beaker contained --- and the other 3 contained ---::IKI (complex carb reagent); water
^1663177404581

Water entered the 1st cell tube, but the starch ---::did not travel out of the cell tube (starch is too big, but water is small enough to diffuse); The inside of the cell tube turned black from the IKI, but outside the tube, the IKI solution remained red
^1663177404587

The 2nd tube gained weight, indicating that ---::water entered the tube (Salt ions cannot travel across membranes, but water can)
^1663177404593

The 3rd tube gained weight, indicating that ---::water entered the tube. However, the beaker water turned orange after benedict's reagent, indicating that some dextrose diffused out of the cell tube. (glucose usually cannot pass through membranes passively)
^1663177404599

The 4th tube did not gain a significant amount of weight because ---::the cell tube and the beaker both contained water; isotonic so no net movement or diffusion
^1663177404605

Smaller SA/VR means the diffusion time takes ---::longer

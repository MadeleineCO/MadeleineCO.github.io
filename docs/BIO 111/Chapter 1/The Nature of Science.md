I. Science aims to understand the natural world through observathion and reasoning
	A. Begins with observations
		- Much of science is purely descriptive
			a. Modifies as more information surfaces
	B. Classification of all life on Earth
		- Human Genome Sequencing [[DNA]]
	C. Two types of reasoning
		- Inductive reasoning
			a. From a number of observations, a general conclusion is drawn
				i. Ex: Number of observations made about fruit flies. They have homeobox genes that help with organizing head to thorax to abdomen (sequential development). Later discovered other organisms with them (including people). Concluded that there is pattern of development in all organisms.
		- Deductive reasoning
			a. From a general premise, specific results are predicted
				i. Ex: Lizards have four legs. If you see a pucture of something without four legs, it is not a lizard. All lizards must have four legs. Can lead to flawed reasoning. There are such things as legless lizards. Lizards are defined by having eyelids whereas snakes cannot have eyelids. Defined difference is in eyelids, not limb count.
			b. Must be careful to come to the right conclusion.
	D. Science must be repeatable and consists of a series of well-defined steps.
		- [[Scientific method]]
		- Philosophical approaches to science
			a. Reductionism
				i. To break a complex process down to its simpler parts
			b. Systems biology
				i. Focus on emergent properties that can't be understood by looking at simpler parts
					~ Google can show flu outbreaks because of people's search history
					~ Metagenomic investigation shows that there are changes and shifts in DNA when ecosystem is healthy vs. unhealthy. Also changes in normal population of bacteria when an [[Organism]] is sick. 
	E. [[Scientific models]]
	F. [[Scientific theory]] and scientific law

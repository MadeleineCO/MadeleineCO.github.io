Gel Electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by ---::size; Uses gel made of agarose and polyacrylamide (carbs); and submersed in a buffer that can carry current; When subjected to electrical field, negatively charged DNA migrates towards pos pole (larger fragments move slower and smaller move faster); DNA is visualized using fluorescent dyes
^1669870203783

The gel electrophoresis uses gel made of ---::agarose and polyacrylamide; Carbohydrates; You get better resolution w/ acrylamide but agar can give you approximation of DNA size
^1669870203792

Gel electrophoresis is like a race where fastest (smallest) pieces are ---::in front and slower (larger) and behind; Pieces that move fastest and farthest are smallest and vise versa
^1669870203798

DNA is visualized in gel electrophoresis using ---::fluorescent dyes; Dye binds to DNA (typically in the minor groove); Called ETBR (ethdimine bromide); The brightest pieces have the most mass (more DNA)
^1669870203806

Molecular ladder is shown on side for ---::comparison when using gel electrophoresis; The ladder has pieces of DNA w/ known sizes and increments; If it is 100 base pair ladder, then smallest is 100, 2nd row is 200, then 3rd is 300, and so on

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)::Developed by Kary Mullis (awarded nobel prize); Allows the amplification of a small DNA fragment using primers that flank the region; Three steps (denaturation, annealing of primers, DNA synthesis)
^1670027922979

The critical enzyme for DNA replication is ---::DNA polymerase; Nucleotides are building blocks, DNA pol must have primer to function; Must be done in buffer environment w/ ideal temp and pH
^1670027922990

If you have a piece of DNA that you want to copy, you can replicate outside ---::the cell (using its complimentary primer and DNA pol); Accomplished via PCR
^1670027922997

Kary Mullis first did PCR w/ E coli ---::polymerase; E coli ideal temp is our body temp (about 37 * C); We now use Taq polymerase (from heat resistant bacteria from hot springs so it can handle heat during denature process)
^1670027923003

In PCR, you take double stranded DNA and first ---::heat it up (which denatures it so that H bonds come apart); Then cool to allow primer to anneal; Once primer is bound, DNA pol can work
^1670027923010

Each PCR cycle involves three ---::steps; Denaturation (high temp), annealing of primers (low temp), and DNA synthesis (intermediate temp using taq polymerase)
^1670027923017

Copying DNA is much easier inside a --- than a cell::test tube; Bc we use a smaller piece, each round of PCR can be accomplished more quickly than normal E coli (20 min binary fission process)
^1670027923023

Applications of PCR::Allows the investigation of minute samples of DNA; Many, many applications, including forensics (drop of blood, cells of hair follicle), Detection of genetic defects in embryos by analyzing a single cell, Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (maternal); We can amplify DNA and look for specific regions

dNTPs (PCR Reaction Component)::Deoxyribonucleotide triphosphastas; Consists of four basic nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP) as building blocks of new DNA strands; Typically added to PCR reaction in equimolar amounts for optimal base incorporation
^1670027923056

Rx buffer (PCR Reaction Component)::Required for proper enzyme function
^1670027923062

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA is made from an RNA template ---::before PCR begins
^1670027923068

The PCR cycle consists of three steps (denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis), that occur at high, low, and intermediate temps, respectively. The cycle is repeated ---::again and again, resulting in a doubling of DNA molecules each time. After several cycles, the vast majority of strands produced are the same length as the distance between the two primers
^1670027923075

Southern blotting::Used to find a particular sequence in a sample of DNA; DNA fragments are separated on a gel, transferred ot a nylon membrane, and incubated w/ a DNA probe (compliment to sequence of interest)
^1670027923082

DNA probe (southern blotting)::Single stranded; Longer than a primer but still pretty short (while primer may be 10-20 nucleotides, probe may be 100-299); Complementary to sequence of interest and labeled w/ fluorescent dye so location of DNA fragments can be visualized
^1670027923088

Northern blotting::Similar to southern blotting but *RNA* is run on the gel instead of DNA
^1670027923094

Western blotting::Similar to southern blotting, but *proteins* are run on gel instead of DNA; Detected using antibodies
^1670027923100

Molecular cloning::Isolation of a specific DNA sequence (usually protein-encoding); Sometimes called gene-cloning; Most flexible and common host for cloning is E coli
^1670027923106

Vector (molecular cloning)::Carries DNA in the host and can replicate in the host; Plasmids have limited insert size, BACs and YACs allow for larger insert for large-scale analysis of genomes
^1670027923113

^1670027923154

In molecular cloning, you have a plasmid w/ a *restriction site* in the middle of a gene (ex lac z, which is used in lac operon for lactose); Recognized by restriction enzyme

If you suddently put a bunch of DNA in the lac operon during molecular cloning, it will completely change the ---::lac Z gene; We can take DNA and have cloning site in middle of lac operon and lac Z gene
^1670027923160

In molecular cloning, the foreign DNA and plasmid are cut w/ the same ---::restriction enzyme, which recognizes a particular sequence of DNA called a restriction site; The restriction site only occurs once in the plasmid and is located within the lac Z gene, which is necessary for metoblizing lactose
^1670027923166

After the restriction enzyme recognizes restriction site on plasmid for molecular cloning, the enzyme creates *sticky ends*, which allow foreign DNA and cloning vector to anneal; Ligase glues the annealed fragments together

Sticky ends::Created by restriction enzyme in molecular cloning; Complementary and naturally want to anneal; Foreign DNA and plasmid have exact same recognition site, so sticky ends in foreign and in plasmid can bind together, thus inserting the foreign DNA
^1670027923173

During molecular cloning, the ligated cloning vector is transformed into a bacterial host strain that is amp sensitive (and missing the lac Z gone)

After the foreign DNA anneals into plasmid in molecular cloning, the bacteria may or may not take up plasmid with or without the insert

The ligated cloning vector is transformed into a bacterial host strain that is ---::ampicillin sensitive and missing the lac Z gene from is genotype
^1670027923180

^1670027923186

Plasmids lacking the foreign DNA insert in molecular cloning have an intact lac Z gene and are able to metabolize ---::X-gal, releasing a dye that turns the colony blue; Plasmids without insert have disrupted lac Z gene and produce white colonies

^1670027923383

Interferon::Used in fighting cancer; Can identify and target cancer cells; Chemo is putting poison in body to kill cancer cells but interferon is natural chemical that is produced in body; If you could scale up production, another method to fight cancer
^1670027923389

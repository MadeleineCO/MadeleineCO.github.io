1. Two equations to determine frequencies
	1. HWE Definition = In a large, randomly mating population, gene/allelic and genotypic frequencies will remain *constant* from generation to generation in the absence of mutation, migration, genetic drift, selection, and recombination.
	2. Allelic frequencies: p + q = 1.0
	3. Genotypic frequencies: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.0
3. Based on Mendel's principles
	1. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
	2. G. H. Hardy (1877-1947)
	3. Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937)
	4. Hardy and Weinberg independently devised the same equation
4. In HWE, the population will be in equilibrium if not disrupted by evolutionary forces
	1. Most populations do not completely follow HWE assumptions
	2. Assumptions
		1. No genetic drift
		2. No mutation
		3. No recombination
		4. No selection
		5. Large, sexually reproducing population
	3. These are all mechanisms acting within populations, an occurrence called "population genetics" - *except* for epigenetic modifications, which act on individuals in a Lamarckian manner
5. Major Evolutionary Mechanisms in HWE
	1. Requirements of HW
		1. Large pop size
		2. Random mating
		3. No mutations
		4. No migration
		5. No natural selection
	2. Violation of HWE (Evolution)
		1. Genetic Drift
		2. Inbreeding and nonrandom mating
		4. Mutations
		5. Migration
		6. Natural Selection
	3. Testing for HWE can be used to assess whether a population is evolving
		1. Are you making progress w/ your crosses?
		2. A pop that is *not* evolving shows allele and genotypic frequencies that are in HWE
		3. If a pop isn't in HWE, it can be concluded that the pop is evolving 
			1. If evolution/change is occurring, then the frequencies will not remain constant from generation to generation
	4. Population = A group of individuals within a species that is capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring
		1. Interbreed + fertile offspring
6. Mathematical Description of Mendelian Inheritance
	1. According to the HW principle, frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a pop remain constant from generation to generation
	2. In a given pop where gametes contribute to the next generation randomly, allele frequencies will not change
	3. Allelic and genotypic frequencies follow the transmission rules of Mendelian inheritance, which maintains constant proportions in a pop across generations
	4. Ex: A flower pop in HWE ![[Pasted image 20230203104106.png]]
		1. Follows Medelian frequencies when in HWE 
	5. If p and q represent the relative frequencies of the only two possible alleles in a pop at a locus then. . .
		1. p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
7. More General HW Equations
	1. One locus, three alleles: (p + q + r)^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr
	2. One locus, n # alleles: (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ... + pn)^2 + 2p1p2 + 2p1p3 + 2p1p4 + ... 2pn-1pn
	3. For a polyploid (more than two chromosomes)
		1. (p + q)^c where c = num of chromosomes
	4. If multiple loci (genes) code for a trait, each locus follows the HW principle independently, and then the genes interact to influence the trait
	5. Example - Violet, pink, and white flowers![[Pasted image 20230206103006.png]]
		1. Punnett square w/ both possible gametes listed and HW variables listed
		2. You can preform the same calculations using percentages
8. Calculating Allele Frequencies from number of individuals
	1. For diploid organisms, the total num of alleles at a locus is the total num of individuals multiplied by two
	2. The total num of dom alleles at a locus is two alleles for each homo dom individual
	3. Add one allele for each hetero individual
		1. The same logic applies for rec individuals
	4. Example
		1. AA = 120, Aa = 60 and aa = 35 (number of individuals)
		2. Num of A = (2 x AA) + Aa = 240 + 60 = 300
		3. Num of a = (2 x aa) + Aa = 70 + 60 + 130
		4. Proportion a = 130/total = 130/430 = 0.30
		5. Proportion of A = 300/total = 300=430 = 0.70
		6. Proportion of AA = 120/215 = 0.56
		7. Proportion of Aa = 60/215 = 0.28
		8. Proportion of aa = 35/215 = 0.16
		9. AA + Aa + aa = 0.56 + 0.28 + 0.16 = 1.0
	5. Applying the HW Principle
		1. Ex: estimate frequency of a disease allele in a population
			1. PKU is a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity of rec allle
				1. Individuals that are homo rec cannot break down phenylamine, resulting in buildup and mental retardation 
			2. PKU = 1 per 10,000 births (frequency of disease allele)
				1. q^2 = 0.0001 so q = sqrt(0.0001) or 0.01
				2. p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99
				3. 2pq = 2(0.99)(0.01) = 0.0198 or approximately 2% of the population
		2. Rare detrimental recessives often remain in a pop bc they are hidden in the hetero state (the carriers)
		3. Natural selection can only act on the homozygous individuals where the phenotype is exposed (individuals who express symptoms of PKU)
9. HWE Deviation
	1. Deviation from HWE indicates that evolution is happening
	2. Ex: AA = 0.64, Aa = 0.32, aa = 0
		1. Does not equal 1, Not in HWE
		2. Could be a result of lethal gene action for homo rec
	3. Any form of change in the frequency violates HWE
		1. Even seemingly small degree from generation to generation

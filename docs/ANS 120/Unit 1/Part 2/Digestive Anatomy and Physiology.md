				i. Cows, sheep, horses cannot digest grass, but the microbes inside of them can
				ii. Symbiotic relationship
			c. Some species do both chemical and microbial, whereas others (such as us) mostly do one
		- Absorption: Transfer of nutrients from the digestive track to the circulatory system 
		- Elimination
			a. Can be non-digestible
				i. When the body has not digested all of the nutrients available in the item
					~ Not all nutrients used effectively (inefficiency)
			b. Or can be indigestible

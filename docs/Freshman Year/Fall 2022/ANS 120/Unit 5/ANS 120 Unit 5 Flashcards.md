^1669072458843

Avians domestication::Relatively recently domesticated; First domesticated for food (like all species); Now main food breed = broiler
^1669072458849

Turkey domestication::Few species from North America; The domesticated turkey can no longer breed (bred for white breast meat but males too big to physically breed)
^1669072458859

Chicken breeds::Egg laying breeds = white leghorn; Meat laying breeds = broiler, white cornish; Multipurpose breeds = Barred Plymouth Rock, rhode island red (especially eggs); Fun breeds = Frizzle, Silkie, Naked Neck, Golden Polish, La Fleche, Ayam Cemani (10x melanin = black)
^1669072458867

Turkey Breeds::Bronze, Bourbon, White, Narragansett; Bred to be so large that we must reproduce by AI
^1669072458874

Geese breeds::Brown Chinese, White Chinese, Pilgrim, African Grey; Feathers, meat, and eggs
^1669072458882

Duck breeds::Pekin, Muscovy, Orpington; Used for feathers, meat, and eggs
^1669072458890

We also raise undomesticated birds, such as ---::Ratities (ostriches and emus; They don't have middle breast bones bc don't fly; Large eggs and red meat); Quail hunting
^1669072458897

Most turkey produced in ---::North Carolina and Minnesota; Turkey consumption has increased but we still eat more chicken than turkey; World poultry meat production is increasing overall
^1669072458905

GA is number 1 in ---::broiler production; Broilers centralized in southeast
^1669072458913

Vertical integration in broiler industry::Infrastructure = production steps; Vertical integration = ownership or control of more than one step in production process (one company owns every step of the process); Major companies include Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Wayne Farms, etc.
^1669072458920

Types of meat birds::Ancestor = Asian jungle fowl (relatively small; 4-6 lbs in 3+ years); Broiler reaches 4-5 lbs in 35-45 days
^1669072458932

Breeding facility for eggs (hatchery)::Laying hen facilities w/ nest boxes and roosters; Eggs go into incubators w/ right temp and rotation; Can then ship chicks (they are fine up till about a week bc of yoke rudiments)
^1669072458940

Sexing chicks by looking at ---::wing feathers; If uneven rows of covert feathers, its a pullet; If rows are even, its a cockrel; May also be able to sex by vent anatomy
^1669072458947

After hatchery, chicks are shipped to ---::broiler houses (grower); Privately owned but contracted by large companies; Process called all in-all out (bring chicks in all at one time then move out all at one time)
^1669072458954

Broiler life cycle::Day 0 = fertilization in hatchery; Day 21 = chicks hatch and transferred to grower; Day 60 - all chickens are removed (35-50 days post-hatching); After day 60 in grower, sterilization/sanitation occurs and by day 75, more chicks enter grower (5-8 broods/year)
^1669072458962

Growers provide ---::climate control, pulley system for feed and waters to facilitate movement of birds; Heater; Food and water (although yolk sac provides nutrients for first couple days)
^1669072458969

Chicks are typically moved out of grower ---::at night bc they are calmer; All chicks move out at once; Then clean litter (usually sawdust) and sanitize before starting over
^1669072458977

[[2022-11-30]]
Growers can have --- broods/year::5-8; Time from all in to all out is about 35-50 days then sanitation after all out takes about 15 more days
^1669867873640

The asian jungle fowl (chicken ancestor) produces about --- eggs per year::4-10; Now our white leghorns produce about 290 per year 
^1669867873652

Birds are almost like --- breeders::long day; longer photo period = more eggs in nature; We have lights in chicken houses that simulate long day
^1669867873660

--- is the country that produces the most eggs by far::Asia; In the US, Ga is 6th greatest egg producer
^1669867873668

Egg production has increased from 264 eggs to about --- per year::296 eggs; We are optimizing the environment
^1669867873677

Egg consumption is --- in the US::going up overall; However, avian flu has killed birds more recently so slight drop (more expensive)
^1669867873684

Vertical integration in the egg industry::Ownership of more than one step; Similar to broiler in that few companies are involved; Companies own almost all of process, from parent breeding to hatching to grow out to egg production to packer and retail
^1669867873691

Egg laying birds are started in similar way to ---::broilers; Moved to grower 1-3 days post hatching; Unlike broilers that only stay for around 30 days, egg laying birds stay for 18-22 weeks (about 6 months); Much lower density and stay until they start laying
^1669867873697

Egg laying birds tend to begin laying at ---::18-22 weeks; Stay in grower until they start laying then transferred to laying chicken houses
^1669867873702

Battery cages::Conventional egg laying method; About 70% of hens; Rows of cages w/ slanted floor; Conveyor belts for eggs and fecal matter (keeps waste away); Automatic waters/feeders; We control environment (temp + humidity); 8-10 birds per cage
^1669867873707

For about a year, we mimic --- for egg production::long day; Environmental control to increase production
^1669867873712

Cage free system::Not in cages; About 30% of hens; Completely indoors; Have nest boxes (facilitates egg collection); Access to floor and roosting area; We still control environment
^1669867873719

Potential issues w/ cage free system::Litter and manure don't have anywhere to go so higher mortality rates from disease
^1669867873724

Free range system::Like cage free but w/ some access to outside; Access to forage is *not* required; Similar issues w/ waste as cage free
^1669867873731

Pasture Raised::Have a cage free indoor area; Must have access to outdoor area and access to natural vegetation
^1669867873738

Debeaking::Intent is to decrease injury/death due to cannibalism; Trims the tip to round it and prevent chickens from hurting other chickens
^1669867873746

Enriched Colony system::Like conventional battery cage system but also has perch, nest box, and scratch pad
^1669867873753

Cage free system actually has highest ---::mortality % due to sanitation and disease problems; Very tough issue to solve; Best way to minimize disease is to decrease density (but this lowers productivity); Egg cannibalism can be issue as well; Pro = less confinement but con = higher mortality/more disease
^1669867873760

Conventional battery cages have the lowest ---::mortality % overall; Confinement is con but lower mortality and less disease is pro
^1669867873767

Where are we headed w/ egg production/consumption?::1 in 6 Americans go hungry on any given day; We shouldn't make eggs more expensive; Very good food source; Cage free cost of production causes good food to be harder to aquire
^1669867873774

Free range pros/cons::Con = predation; Mortality and disease depends on density; Pro = less confinement; Similar pros/cons to pasture raised
^1669867873782

In conventional system, eggs move down conveyer belt to ---::scalding wash; In Europe, eggs are not washed bc eggs have pores that bacterial can live in to survive washing; Mucus film also prevents material from getting in egg and keeps egg hydrated; Healthwise washing vs nonwashing works out about the same
^1669867873789

After washing, eggs go through the ---::candling process; Purpose is to check shell integrity; Looks for cracks and checks (pinhole cracks); Also looking for meat and blood spots (blood comes from follicle rupture and tissue is constantly replacing itself in bird so piece could get incorporated)
^1669867873796

Some equipment can automize candling process by using ---::sound instead; Sound waves detect shell issues
^1669867873804

Egg variations::Sometimes there are eggs w/ no shell (uterus skipped step); Eggs can be different sizes (Size determined by material that goes down oviduct such as yoke and albumin); Double ovulation can make extra large egg (two yokes); If fertilized, these eggs would not make it
^1669867873811

After candling, eggs go through series of ---::grading; Size (class) and quality (grade)
^1669867873818

Egg anatomy::Germinal around yoke is the unfertilized ovum; Albumin on inside (protein source); Chalazae holds yoke in the middle; Shell on outside
^1669867873826

Size (class)::Based on weight by the dozen; Jumbo = 30 ounces; Extra large = 27; Large = 24; Medium = 21; Small = 18; Peewee = 15
^1669867873833

Quality (grade)::Depends on the size of air cell (determines the amount of material within the egg); AA has smallest air cell, then A, then B; Less air cell is better bc more material (more yoke + albumin)
^1669867873841

Yolk color is controlled by ---::concentration of zanothophylls and carotenes; Color pigmentations that are diet-related; What bird eats controls coloration of yoke (insect tend to be redder, cottonseed makes yolks green)
^1669867873849

Laying Life Cycle::Fertilization --> Hatching (incubation takes 21 days); Moved to grower after hatching; At 6 months, all go out of grower to enter laying phase; Laying phase = 50 weeks; Induced molting = lasts 9-14 days after phase I; Laying Phase II = 30-40 weeks; May repeat cycle or may be shipped to processing
^1669867873857

Laying phase I is --- weeks long::50; Controlled by 14 hrs of light and 10 hrs of darkness; Laying peak at about 20-30 weeks until before egg production goes down; Then need recovery time in form of induced molting
^1669867873864

Induced molting::Occurs at the end of laying phase; Turn off lights to change diurnal (either 24 hrs light or 24 hrs dark; Usually dark to prevent fighting); Provide water but no food
^1669867873872

Induced molting continues until the birds lose ---::about 25% of body weight; Birds quit laying eggs during this time; Gets rid of excess body fat and allows for repro tract involution (repair time)
^1669867873880

Induced molting does not ---::force loss of feathers, but feathers do fall out more than they normally would bc stress of not eating; Not a true molting
^1669867873888

Laying phase II is shorter than ---::phase I (50 weeks vs 35-40 weeks); After this phase, some may repeat cycle but most birds shipped to processing
^1669867873896

1. History
	- Griffith (1920's) concluded that. . .
		1. Information determining virulence could pass from killed Streptococcus strains into live strains
			- He called this transfer of info "transformation"
		2. If injected live S, it died. If injected live R strain, mice lived. He took S strained bacteria and boiled them. If injected killed S strain into mouse, it did not die. 
			- Then mixed dead S and live R and injected it. Mice died.
	- Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1940s)
		1. Repeated Griffith's experiments and discovered. . .
			- Removal of [[Protein]] did not destroy the ability of killed strains to transform live strains, but removal of [[DNA]] did destroy transforming ability.
		2. There are radioactive isotopes of elements such as phosphorous. Radioactive isotope of P-31 is P-32. Nucleic acids have ribose sugar, nitrogenous base, and phosphates. If we incorporate radioactive P into [[DNA]], then we can track it.
			- This is how they saw that removal of [[DNA]] destroyed transforming ability vs when [[DNA]] present, death occurred in mice bc of transformation. 
	- Hershey and Chase (1950s)
		1. Investigated bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria)
			- Bacteriophages cannot infect us, just focused on bacteria
			- Viruses are just [[Nucleic Acid]] packaged in [[Protein]] coat. Not living.
			- Question: Which of these [[Macromolecules]] is the genetic material that is injected into the bacteria?
			- Bacteriophage [[DNA]] labeled w/ radioactive phosphorus (32P) and bacteriophage [[Protein]] labeled w/ radioactive sulfur (35S)
				1. Proteins have sulfur as one of side chains in [[Amino Acids]]
				2. Cystine has sulfur in its R group (side chain)
				3. No sulfur in nucleotides
				4. Proteins do not have phosphorous (unless phosphorylated)
				5. The radiation that comes of P32 is much higher than S35. P32 half life is only about 2 weeks. S35 you don't have to work behind a shield (lot lower [[Energy]] radiation). 
				6. Radioactive molecules were tracked
			- P32 went into [[DNA]]. Virus infects bacteria. As bacteria grows and replicates, radioactive virus builds inside bacteria. Centrifuged to separate phage from bacteria.
			- S35 [[Protein]] coat went into bacteria w/ virus. Centrifuged. 
			- Discovered that only P32 was found inside the bacteria after infection by the virus.
			- Conclusion: [[DNA]] is the genetic material

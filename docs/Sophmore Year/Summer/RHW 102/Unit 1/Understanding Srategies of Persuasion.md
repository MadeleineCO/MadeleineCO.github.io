	1. Often feature a photo of a celebrity to try to get their readers to connect emotionally w/ their products
		1. Ethos
	2. Commercials often use compelling stories or memorable examples to hook their audiences
		1. Pathos
	3. Brochures tend to incorporate impressive statistics or factual evidence to support their claims
		1. Logos
	4. Often use a combination of factors to convince an audience
		1. Such techniques are called *rhetorical strategies*
			1. We can detect rhetorical strategies writers select to convince their audiences
			2. Learning these strategies allows us to become effective readers and produce our own persuasive texts (whether written or multimodal)
2. Strategies of argumentation to persuade
	1. Narration: Using a story to draw in the audience
	2. Comparison-Contrast: Making a point through showing similarities or differences between two or more items
	3. Example/Illustration: Focusing on a specific, representative example to persuade your reader
	4. Cause and Effect: Structuring an argument around the causal relationship between two elements, considering why something occurred or happened
	5. Definition: Defining a term, concept, or theoretical premise for your reader
	6. Analogy: Using a simpler or more familiar concept or metaphor to help an audience understand a complicated idea
	7. Description: Describing an element, event, or idea in detail so as to set up background or create an impression on your reader
	8. Process: Persuading through showing a series of sequential steps
	9. Classification and Division: Helping the reader understand either how individual elements fit into a larger category or set of ideas OR how a larger category breaks down into component parts
3. Aristotle differentiated between inartistic and artistic proofs
	1. Inartistic proofs
		1. Elements available to the writer but not created by the writer
		2. Statistics, laws, quotations, facts, etc.
	2. Artistic proofs
		1. Comprise arguments that the speaker constructs through rhetorical strategies
			1. As described above
		2. They might leverage facts or external evidence, but the arguments themselves are designed by the author
		3. From Aristotle's perspective, artistic proofs were derived from one of three rhetorical appeals
			1. Pathos
				1. Develops emotional connection w/ audience
			2. Logos
				1. Persuades through facts and reasoning
			3. Ethos
				1. Appeals to the authority or credibility of a person's character
4. Exaggerated Uses of Pathos
	1. Scare tactic: Capitalizes on the audience's fears, sometimes unreasonably, to make a point
	2. Slippery slope: Variation of the scare tactic that suggest that one act will lead to a chain of events that results in an unforeseen, inevitable, and usually undesirable conclusion
		1. Does not provide any evidence to support the claim
	3. Oversentimentalization: The overabundant use of pathos can outweigh a focus on relevant issues
	4. Bandwagon appeal: Sometimes called the ad populum argument, this emotional fallacy hinges on the premise that since everyone else is doing something, you should too
	5. False need: Amplifies a perceived need or creates a completely new one 
5. Appeals to Reason through Logos
	1. Inductive reasoning is a line of argument that moves from specific examples to a generalized conclusion
		1. Ex: if you reflect on all times you pulled all-nighteries and ended up failing, you might inductively reason that pulling all-nighters have a negative effect on your grade (the generalized conclusion)
	2. Deductive reasoning is a form of logic that bases argument on how premises (often unstated assumptions) work together to prove an argument
		1. Idea is that premises are accepted as true so argument must be true
		2. Ex: Premise 1 = a college degree helps students find a fulfilling career. Premise 2 = everyone wants a fulfilling career. Argument = university students position themselves to have a fulfilling career
	3. A cause and effect strategy demonstrates logically how one idea, event, or element causes another
	4. Can also rely an examples to support claims
6. Misuses of Ethos
	1. Tend to involve a breach of trust between the author and the audience
		1. You should not abuse this ethical contract w/ your reader
	2. Ad hominin: Attempts to persuade by reducing the credibility of opposing positions through attacks on a person's character
		1. Criticizes speaker rather than argument itself
	3. Argument from authority: Involves a misrepresentation of skills and wisdom
		1. Writer contends to be an authority based on overinflated or fallacious suggestion of expertise 
	4. Association fallacies: Often takes form of "guilt by association" where argument is dismissed because it is associated w/ an undesirably person or position 
	5. Appeal to anonymous authority: References broad, unspecified groups as its authority
		1. Ex: "Four out of five dentists surveyed. . ." or "Studies indicate. . ."
	6. Authority over evidence: Involves practices of overemphasizing authority or ethos rather than focusing on merits of the evidence itself
7. Considering Context and Values when using Kairos and Doxa
	1. Kairos = argument's attention to the right time and place
		1. Consider the opportune historical, ideological, or cultural moment of a text
	2. Doxa means "popular opinion" or "belief"
		1. A learned value system since it refers to those values or beliefs that are deeply help by a particular community at a particular place and moment in time
		2. Related to dogma, or unchanging doctrine
			1. Doxa can and does change over time

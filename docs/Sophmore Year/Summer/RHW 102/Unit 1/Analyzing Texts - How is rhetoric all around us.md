		6. Once you recognize how texts function rhetorically (how they try to persuade you or shape your opinion), then you can decide whether or not to agree
3. Understanding the Rhetorical Situation
	1. Aristotle characterized rhetoric as the ability to see the available means of persuasion in any given situation
		1. In 4th century BCE, free men used rhetoric to represent themselves in court
		2. Today, term rhetoric has expanded to include any verbal, visual, or multimedia text that aims to persuade a specific audience in a certain place and time
	2. You can understand rhetoric as the strategies people use to convey ideas
		1. Andrea Lunsford says that "rhetoric is the art, practice, and study of human communication"
			1. Persuasion is a part of this, but within broader field of communication
	3. To understand a rhetorical text, need to analyze how it targets specific audience and how it has been composed by specific author
		1. Conveys a specific argument
		2. This dynamic relationship called the rhetorical situation
4. Understanding Exigence and Purpose
	1. Exigence = the urgent demand that writers feel to respond to a situation 
		1. Rhetoric is connected to action and change
		2. Demands put on writer to respond immediately and urgently in attempt to take action or raise a concern about a specific problem or issue
	2. Lloyd Bitzer emphasized that rhetorical exigency happens when change is possible
		1. "An exigence is rhetorical when it is capable of positive modification and when positive modification requires discourse or can be assisted by discourse."
		2. Rhetorical exigency exists when there is the possibility that discourse (i.e. forms of communication) can affect change
	3. Understanding exigence can help us understand an author's purpose
		1. Many rhetoricians identify broad types of possible purposes for communication
			1. Entertain
			2. Inform
			3. Explain
			4. Persuade
		2. However, purpose can be more nuanced
			1. An author's purpose might be to describe, define, influence, or call to action
		3. By examining author's motive, we can get better understanding of rhetorical choices they made in communicating w/ their audience 
		4. Rhetoric is far from "empty"
			1. Rather can motivate audiences to produce particular outcomes
5. Rhetoric operates not just through word choice but also through choice of multimedia elements
	1. Ex: images in commercial, audio of a viral ad, design choices of flyer, even layout strat of textbook
	2. Therefore, we need to develop analysis skills for all rhetorical texts
		1. Understand argument writing as writing across diverse media
		2. Critical literacy
	3. Analyzing Visual Rhetoric
		1. When persuasion happens through visual means, we must investigate visual rhetoric
		2. Visual elements surround us constantly 
		3. Can use them as starting point for strategies for analysis that we can then transfer to how we approach analysis of written rhetoric
		4. Argument: What issue does this image address or represent?
		5. Audience: How did author compose text to persuade a particular audience? Who is the audience? How does it address this audience? Is this text conservative or liberal? How does it speak to its audience?
		6. Author: What do you know about the creator? What do they normally produce? What is their story? 
		7. Genre: How did the author either trade on or depart from the conventions of a particular genre (such as the conventional essay, blogging, etc.) How did that decision influence the persuasiveness of the argument? 
		8. Style: How did the author use style as a persuasive tool?
		9. Imagery: what choices of imagery and content does the artist make? Are the drawings realistic? How is the setting portrayed? Does the artist include allusion of references to past or present events or ideas? How do images and words work together (if words are present)? What about color, placemen, and typography?
		10. Tone: Is the image primarily comic or serious in tone? How does this choice of tone create a powerful impact on readers?
		11. Exigence and Purpose: How does the text (image) respond to a pressing need? What is the author's purpose, and to what extend does he or she accomplish it?
		12. Cultural resonance: Does this image refer to any actual people, events, or pop culture icons? Is symbolism used in the image? Why is it important in a certain time and place? 
		13. How does the text (image) appeal to Pathos (emotion; ex - cute dogs in animal shelter), Ethos (character; ex - support of famous doctor), Logos (logic; ex - use of statistics), Kairos (timeliness; ex - response to something happening right now (such as gas shortage, election, etc.)), and/or Doxa (values; ex - american values or dream)?

1. Populations & Genetics
	1. Population = all the individuals in one area at one time that may interbreed and exchange genes
	2. Population genetics
		1. Evolution -> genes change
		2. Through genetic variation
			1. Within individuals of a population
			2. Measure alleles (P vs p)
			3. Over generations
		3. Identify forces that cause changes
			1. If changes compound -> new spp
	3. Microevolution = slow selective pressure that affects alleles in a population
		1. Measurable unlike macroevolution
		2. Hardy-Weinberg Principle
2. [[Genetic Variation in Populations]]
3. Microevolution
	1. "Small scale" evolution
		1. Populations evolve, not individuals
	2. Genes + Env = Expressed Traits 
		1. Evolution = genetic change
			1. Change in allele frequency in population through time
	3. Track the alleles and genotypes
		1. Gene pool (all the alleles in a population)
			1. Dominant (p) vs recessive (q) trait
				1. To calculate the frequency in the population: p + q = 1.0
				2. Frequency of dominant allele (p) plus frequency of recessive allele (q) should equal one (the entire gene pool)
		2. Phenotypes inform genetics
	4. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
		1. Like the null hypothesis to evolution
			1. A non-evolving population
				1. Genotype frequencies 
					1. Hardy-Weinberg Principle = p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.0
					2. pp + 2pq + qq = 1.0
					3. 1:2:1 ratio - (1pp + 2pq + 1qq = 1.0)
				3. Allele and genotype frequencies in equilibrium
					1. May go up and down a bit but overall stable
				4. Only follows Mendelian inheritance
				5. Random mating
					1. No sexual selection
				6. Large, sexually reproducing population
		2. Is true if. . .
			1. No mutations (no changes in allele at DNA level)
			2. No migration (individuals don't leave or enter the population)
			3. Large gene pool (the population)
			4. Random mating (individuals pair/mate by chance, not by choice)
			6. No selection (no one phenotype favored over another)
		3. In realistic terms, the population is likely evolving and these conditions are not true
			1. Serves as an initial test of evolution on the population
		4. Ex: Microevolution of pepper moths
			1. Peppered moths (2N)
				1. Color gene (two alleles)
					1. D (dark) vs d (light)
						1. Dark is dominant
							1. DD or Dd = dark
						2. Lights is recessive
							1. dd = light
			2. Allelic frequencies
				1. Sample 25 moths = 50 alleles
					1. D = 10 & d = 40
					2. p (dom; D) and q (rec; d)
					3. p = 0.20 and q = 0.80
						1. p + q = 1.0
							1. If no change in p and q then no evolution. Change = evolution
				2. Proportion of alleles in a population
					1. Representative subsample of a whole population
					2. Looks at the gene pool
			3. Hardy-Weinberg Principle
				1. Genotypic \ frequencies
				2. p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.0
					1. p2 = DD frequency (homo dom)        1
					2. 2pq = Dd frequency (hetero)              2
					3. q2 = dd frequency (homo rec)           1
					4. 1:2:1 if following Mandel's theories
					5. (.2)2 + 2(.2)(.8) + (.8)2 = 1.0
						1. p2 = 0.04
						2. pq = 0.32
						3. q = 0.64
						4. Gives us the genotypic frequencies from the allelic frequencies
							1. Phenotypic frequencies can be derived from that 
						5. In this example, most of population is light-colored
							1. Favored selection for light color
							2. Mandel would say phenotypic frequencies should be 3:1 so we can observe a difference
			4. Moths cling to tree trunks
				1. Prior to industrial revolution
					1. Birds readily consumed dark
					2. Light color (dd) was better camo
				2. Post industrial revolution
					1. Moth alleles changed from 1800s into late 1900s
					2. Anthropogenic shifts
						1. Means man-made or caused by humans
					4. Burning coal created soot that settled on the trees
						1. Trees used to be light colored but turned dark
						2. Allelic frequency of light went down while dark went up
						3. Flipped from mostly light to mostly dark
				3. Then industry regulations limited how much soot could be released from factories
					1. Less soot = increase in dark moth predation
					2. Trees become lighter again
				4. Changes seen over generations
4. Genetic Drift
	1. Change in alleles by chance
		1. Random event
			1. Change not linked w/ evolution
		2. Occurs regardless of genotype or phenotype
			1. So great of a change that changes occur despite genotype
		3. Ex: natural disaster
			1. Could end up w/ more brown rabbits because they were farther away from volcano than black rabbits
	2. Founder effect
		1. When a few individuals leave populations
			1. Could be difficult to get population started in new area
			2. Once reproduction does occur, an established population may develop
		2. Limited gene pool initially
			1. Adaptability is restricted by small gene pool
		3. Likely carried over recessive traits
			1. Could be detrimental, but so little genetic variation that population is susceptible to maladaptive traits
			2. Homozygosity and inbreeding
	3. Genetic bottleneck
		1. Small fragmented populations
			1. Populations could be isolated by something as seemingly insignificant as a road
		2. Limited genetic diversity
			1. Gene pool is restricted
			2. Adaptability is restricted
			3. Homozygosity and inbreeding
	4. Consequences of Genetic Drift
		1. Significant in small populations
			1. Observed in all populations
			2. Goes against HW principle assumption
		2. Allele frequency may change at random
			1. See marked year-to-year variation
			2. Does not indicate evolution
		3. Loss of genetic variation within population
			1. Habitat fragmentation from human activities
			2. Less resistant to environmental change
		4. Harmful alleles may become fixed
			1. Compound the bottleneck affect
			2. Difficult to naturally remove
5. Gene Flow
	1. The transfer of alleles either into or out of a population
		1. Exchange from an external source
	2. Ex: banded water snake
		1. Solid snakes vs banding pattern
			1. Solid snakes mostly found on islands and banding mostly found on mainland
				1. Island is rocky so solid blends in while mainland is marshy so banding helps w/ camo
			2. Mainland snakes migrate to the island
				1. Multiple individuals every year 
				2. Keeps banded alleles in island populations
6. Natural Selection
	1. Random variation & non-random selection
		1. Genes already in pop then pressure selects
	2. Absolute fitness = Average individual contribution to the gene pool
	3. Relative fitness = an individual's contribution to the gene pool realitve to the avg of all individuals
	4. Genetically fit individuals 
		1. More likely to contribute genes
		2. Sometimes involve actual competition
		3. AKA "the survival of the fittest"
			1. Individuals w/ best genes have advantage and more likely to propagate favorable genes 
	5. Types of Natural Selection
		1. Sometimes seen and sometimes unseen
			1. Unseen ex: SCA
			2. Seen ex: fur color
		2. Directional selection
			1. When a population is being pushed into one phenotype
				1. Ex: population turns from brown fur to black fur
			2. Extreme phenotype is favored
			3. May occur as population adapts
			4. Ex: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics
				1. Only left w/ resistant bacteria
				2. Resistant mutations more likely to propagate 
				3. Some bacteria can go a step further and consume antibiotics
		3. Disruptive selection
			1. When a population is pressured into two extremes
				1. Ex: population overall is either black or white
			2. Two extreme phenotypes are favored instead of intermediate
			3. Ex: British land snails
				1. Light color -> favored in low veg
				2. Dark color -> favored in forest
			4. Two phenotypes in same population
		4. Stabilizing selection
			1. When a population is favored towards the middle (or average)
				1. Ex: population is pushed towards grey (extremes are black and white)
			2. Intermediate form is selected
				1. More likely to be carried over
			3. Ex: clutch size in birds
				1. Too few -> not enough offspring make it
				2. Too many -> not enough nutrients for each
				3. Intermediate form is the sweet spot
			4. Ex: birth size in humans
				1. Too low -> not sufficiently developed
				2. Too high -> difficult/stressful delivery
			5. Reduces phenotype variability
7. Sexual Selection
	1. Adaptive changes to males and females
		1. Male -> increased ability to compete
		2. Female -> preferential selection of male
	2. Sexual dimorphism
		1. Distinct differences between sex
			1. Clear male and female
		2. Size and color are the most common forms
	3. Intrasexual selection
		1. "Within the sex" = intra
			1. Individuals within the sex compete
		2. Males patrol/protect territory
		3. Psychological effect to prevent physical
			1. Ex: puffing up chest to scare off rival
			2. Better as a species bc not killing off species to reproduce
		4. Ex: male elephant seals fight each other 
	4. Intersexual selection
		1. Mate choice is noticeable
		2. Chooses individuals w/ better genes
		3. Ex: colorful bird mating displays
8. Balancing Selection
	1. Maintenance of undesirable alleles in a population
		1. May see a detrimental trait remain in a species
		2. Ex: SCA and the heterozygote advantage 
	2. Frequency-dependent
		1. Changes based on the frequency of the phenotype
		2. Ex: left vs right mouthed cichlids
			1. Prey species defend against the majority
				1. Left scale remover vs Right scale remover attack
			2. Natural fluctuation occurs as a result
				1. Actual frequency should be about 50% each but one is usually more prevalent than the other and it swings back and forth
	3. Heterozygote advantage
		1. When the heterozygote has better fitness than the homozygote
		2. Defined by genotype
			1. Effect depends on pheno of hetero
			2. Intermediate form yields stabilizing
		3. Ex: SCA trait
			1. Heterozygotes have malaria resistance in Sub-Saharan Africa
			2. This is the reason why the SCA trait does not go away in the pop
		4. Recessive alleles are carried over
9. Evolution and Natural Selection
	1. Selection acts on existing variation
		1. Evolution does not create genes, it selects for or against them
		2. Ex: Mismatched fur color of hares caused by climate change and snowfall
	2. Evolution limited by historical constraints
		1. Previous structures are changed incrementally via selection
		2. Cannot create new genes
		3. Ex: wings derived from similar endoskeleton bones 
	3. Adaptions are often compromises
		1. One trait is best adapted for the env
		2. Same trait is limited or maladapted for another
		3. Ex: Seal flippers in water vs on land

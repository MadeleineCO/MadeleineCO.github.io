1. Cell Theory: every organism is made up of at least one cell
	1. Cell is the basic unit of life
	2. Produced by division of pre-existing cells
2. Prokaryotic Cells: lack membrane-bound organelles
	1. Relatively simple interior structure
	2. Region of DNA (nucleoid) instead of nucleus DNA
	3. DNA single circular molecules
	4. Small ribosomes
	5. Reproduced by fission
	6. 1-10 microns in diameter
		- A micron is 1 millionth of a meter
	7. Types
		- Bacteria
			- Coccus (round/spherical)
			- Bacillus (rod-shaped)
			- Spirillum (corkscrew/spiral)
		- Archaea
			- Thermophiles
				1. Very hot
			- Halophiles
				1. Very salty
			- Found in extreme environments
		- Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)
			- Oscillatoria and Anabaena
			- Can photosynthesize
			- Provide oxygen
3. Eukaryotic Cells
	1. Cytomembrane (endomembrane) system and membrane bound organelles
	2. Relatively complex interior structure
	3. DNA in nucleus
	4. DNA in chromatin (individual chromosomes)
	5. Large ribosomes
	6. Reproduce by mitosis and meiosis
	7. Larger cells (10-1000 microns in diameter)
	8. Types
		- Protists
			- Single celled organisms
			- Paramecium
			- Amoeba
			- Euglena
			- Volvox
			- Physarum
				- Slime mold
		- Fungi
			- Yeast
		- Plants
			- Elodea
			- Have cell walls made up of cellulose 
		- Animals
			- Human cheek cell

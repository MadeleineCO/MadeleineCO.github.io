Isotonic::Two solutions have same osmotic concentration; No net movement of water
^1663200159606

Aquaporins::Channels that facilitate water movement across membrane; Like pipes that open to allow a lot of water through; Water can diffuse in small amounts without aquaporins
^1663200159613

Osmotic pressure::Force needed to stop osmotic flow; A hypertonic cell gains water causing it to swell, which creates pressure; If membrane strong, cell reaches counterbalance of driving water in w/ hydrostatic pressure driving water out (Cell wall); If membrane not strong, cell may burst

^1663200159666

Plant cells use --- to push the cell membrane against the cell wall and keep the cell rigid::turgor pressure (Hypertonic = too little turgor pressure, membrane pulled in, everything is concentrated) (Hypotonic = too much turgor pressure and membrane pressed against cell wall)
^1663200159673

A paramecium's contractile vacuole continuously pumps ---::water out of body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium
^1663200159680

Active transport::Requires energy to move substances across membrane (ATP is used directly or indirectly as fuel); Moves substances from low to high concentration against gradient via highly selective carrier proteins
^1663200159686

^1663200159725

ATP energy is use to change the --- of Na+-K+ carrier protein::conformation; Affinity of carrier protein for either sodium or potassium ions changes so they can be carrier across membrane (Function altered when structure altered)
^1663200159732

Na+-K+ pumps adds or removes phosphate from ATP, allowing it to---::release K+ to inside and move Na+ to outside, respectively
^1663200159737

When Na+-K+ pump takes a phosphate from ATP, it becomes ---::ADP (adonosine diphosphate), consequently changing tertiary structure of protein as it adds or removes phosphate and breaks or recreates ATP. This allows it to switch between binding K+ and Na+

^1663200159757

Glucose-Na+ symporter::Coupled transport; Captures energy from Na+ diffusion to move glucose against a concentration gradient; Na+ naturrly wants to diffuse into cell, so glucose binds to Na+ and tags along to enter the cell
^1663200159764

Glucose-Na+ symporter changes --- when glucose and sodium are bound and when they are not bound::tertiary structure (binds one glucose and two sodium and glucose tags along w/ sodium during diffusion)
^1663200159770

Glucose-Na+ proteins cause Na+ concentration to go up in cell, so the --- must release the extra sodium::Na+-K+ pump

^1663200159790

Endocytosis::Movement of substances into cell
^1663200159796

Phagocytosis::Cell takes in particular matter (ex: white blood cell engulfing bacteria); Cell membrane surrounds particle and engulfs it, creates a vesicle w/ substance inside, and fuses to lysosome to digest substance inside
^1663200159803

Pinocytosis::Cell takes in only fluid; Cell membrane invaginates, surrounds some fluid, and pinches off (creates a bubble to transport into cell)
^1663200159810

Receptor-mediated endocytosis::Specific molecules are takin into cell after they bind to a receptor on external plasma membrane; Uptake is targeted to single type of substance; Creates a vesicle w/ receptors and substance inside and clathrin coat on outside

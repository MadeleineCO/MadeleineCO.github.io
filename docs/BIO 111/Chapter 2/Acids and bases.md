I. Pure [[Water]]
	A. Considered to be neutral
	B. Neither acidic nor basic
		- [H+] of 10^-7 mol/L
	C. pH is the negative log of hydrogen ion concentration of solution
		- Measures the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] in a solution
		- 0-14 with 7 as neutral
		- The lower the number, the more acidic (more hydrogen ions)
		- The higher the number, the more basic (more hydroxide ions)
		- One whole number is 10x different
			a. Ex: Concentration of 5 is 10x more than 4
	D. Buffers
		- Substance that resists changes in pH
			a. Prevents rapid change
			b. Like a shock absorber
		- Act by releasing hydrogen ions when a base is added [[Chemical Bonds]]
			a. Absorbing hydrogen ions when acid is added
		- Overall effect of keeping [H+] is relatively constant
		- Usually works within the pH range of 4-6 (can vary)
			a. As we increase the amount of base [OH-], the buffer holds it within the 4-6 range by absorbing extra amount
			b. Comes to a point where it can't buffer anymore
	E. As you hold breath, increases concentration of H3 + HCO3- $$H^{+} + HCO_{3}^{-} {\color{Magenta} \leftarrow}{\color{Blue}  \rightarrow } H_{2}CO_{3} {\color{Magenta} \leftarrow}{\color{Blue}  \rightarrow } H_{2}O + CO_{2}$$
		- The longer you hold breath, the more acidic
		- Holding breath shifts to the leftside and breathing shifts to the rightside
		- This diagram shows the body's buffering of blood pH levels
			a. Right (blue) arrows show process of raising pH as more CO2 is made
			B. Left (magenta) arrows indicate the reverse process
				i. The lowering of pH as more bicarbonate is created

Mendel did not know about ---. Just making observations::genes; By early 1900s, scientists aware of genes and chromosomes=
^1666996905876

Chromosomal theory history::Sutton and Boveri both proposed that genes are present on chromosomes in the early 1900s; Observed that homologous chromosomes pair with each other during meiosis
^1666996905887

Sutton and Boveri studied ---::fruit flies (Drosophila spp.); Observed meiosis and developed theories about chromosomes and linkage; Could get multiple fruit fly generations within a year
^1666996905895


Chromosomal theory of inheritance::Inheritance patterns of unlinked vs linked genes; Linked genes do not segregate randomly during meiosis
^1666996905902

Sex determination of fruit flies is based on the ---::num of X chromosomes; 2 Xs = female; 1 X = male
^1666996905910

In humans sex determination is based on ---::the Y chromosome; 2 Xs = female; 1 Y = male; Y chromosome carries genes for "maleness" relating to SRY gene, testosterone, and apoptosis of female characteristics in utero  
^1666996905917
[[2022-11-02]]
SRY gene:: On Y chromosome and associated w/ testosterone; Like first domino of genes that leads to development of maleness
^1667437173281

Point in early development where embryo has differentiated cells and adjacent cells communicate. At about 6 weeks, the embryo has tissue that will become gonad tissue (bipotential tissue bc could become male or female) SRY gene starts production of ---::male hormones (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)); DHT is associated w/ male pattern baldness
^1667437173289

Different animals can have different ---::sex chromosomes (Male birds have ZZ and females have ZW); However, across all species, testosterone and estrogen used as sex hormones
^1667437173295

In many organisms, the Y chromosome is greatly ---::reduced or inactive; X-linked genes are present in only 1 copy in males, but 2 copies in females; One X is so condensed in females that info is not be accessed  
^1667437173301

Sex-linked traits (bio)::Controlled by genes on the X or Y chromosome; show inheritance patterns different than those of genes on autosomal chromosomes
^1667437189516

Most traits are --- traits (on chromosomes 1-22)::autosomal; 23rd pair are sex chromosomes 
^1667437173308

Father determines sex of offspring bc have either --- sperm while mother can only have --- eggs::X or Y; X
^1667437173314

Morgan's fruit flies::Red-eyed female  x  “mutant” white-eyed male gave a F1 generation all with red eyes (red eyes are dominant); F1 females x F1 males = F2 both red and white- eyed flies (all white-eyed flies were male; did not follow normal 3:1 phenotypic ratio)
^1667437173319

Wild type::Dominant allele/phenotype; Ex: wild type fruit fly has red eyes (vs sex-linked white eyes)
^1667437173325

Mogan's fruit fly testcross::F1 female x F2 white-eyed male showed that white-eyed females were possible and viable; Conclusion: the eye color gene is found on the X chromosome (fruit fly eye color is a “sex-linked” (“X-linked”) trait)
^1667437173335

Any time you testcross, you use known --- individual (ex white eyed male) x unknown (either homo dom or hetero female)::recessive
^1667437173341

Pedigree of hemophilia::Females can be healthy, carriers, or hemophiliac; Males can be healthy or hemophiliac. In British royal family, none of the females after QV have been hemophiliac (requires at least a carrier mother mating with a hemophiliac father); Based upon the pedigree, the mutation had to have first arisen in Queen Victoria herself
^1667437173348

Hemophilia; X-linked disorder causing problem w/ blood clotting; Normal enzyme activity not correct to start clotting when a blood vessel damaged; Likely to bleed longer

Dosage compensation::Ensures equal gene expression even though females have 2 “X”s and males have only 1; In female cells, 1 “X” is inactivated and condensed into a *Barr body*
^1667437173354

Females heterozygous for X-linked genes are ---::genetic mosaics (expressing the dominant allele in some cells, the recessive allele in other cells); Ex: Calico cats have barr bodies w/ two different alleles on Xs (orange and black). In some cells, black is tightly packed so orange is expressed. Opposite in other cells.
^1667437173360

DNA mutations can cause ---::altered proteins once the genes are transcribed and translated; Altered proteins may not function correctly, causing a phenotypic change; In some cases, the protein can be altered at only a single amino acid and still cause several problems (ex pleiotropy in sickle cell anemia)
^1667437173365

Sickle cell anemia::On p arm, there is beta hemoglobin gene; Normal hemoglobin made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains. A certain nucleotide creates glutamic acid on normal beta chain in primary [[Protein]] sequence. At gene that should create glutamic acid mutated as a different nucleotide that creates valine instead. Creates nonpolar region that clusters w/ other nonpolar things. Causes red blood [[Cell|cells]] to have altered shapes.
^1667437173369

Some genetic disorders are caused by changes in ---::chromosome number; Nondisjunction during meiosis can create gametes having too many or too few chromosomes; Fertilization of these gametes creates trisomic (too many) or monosomic (too few) individuals
^1667437173374

Down syndrome is trisomy of ---::chromosome 21; Different degrees of severity and phenotypic characteristics; Incidence of Down Syndrome increases w/ mother's age bc nondisjunction during meiosis increases w/ aging
^1667437173380

Nondisjunction of sex chromosomes of females can result in ---::XXX triple-X syndrome daughters, XXY sons (Klinefelter syndrome), XO daughters (Turner syndrome), XYY sons (Jacob syndrome), OY nonviable zygotes
^1667437173386

Sometimes, parts of chromosomes can ---::break off or be deleted; Ex: Cri-du-chat syndrome occurs when section of chromosome 5 missing, causing distinctive facial features; 1-p36 deletion syndrome; Part of chromosome 4 can break then be attached to chromosome 12; If baby is born, there is often developmental disability
^1667437173391

Genomic imprinting::Occurs when the phenotype produced by a particular allele depends on which parent contributed the allele to the offspring
^1667437173397

A mutated chromosome 15 results in either ---::Prader-Willi syndrome if from the father (hypotonia, hypogonadism, hyperphagia, cognitive impairment, difficult behaviors, morbid obesity) or Angelman syndrome if from the mother (jerky gait, lack of speech, excessive laughter and seizures); Example of genomic imprinting
^1667437173402

Chromosomal theory exceptions::Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain chromosomes; Traits controlled by genes on these chromosomes do not follow the same inheritance patterns as autosomal chromosomes;  Mitochondrial and chloroplast chromosomes are often passed to the offspring by only one parent (usually the female via the egg)
^1667437173408

Maternal inheritance::Uniparental (one-parent) inheritance from the mother only (chromosomal theory exception); Mitochondria are in eggs but usually not sperm. So, mitochondria in the offspring come from the mother
^1667437173414

In plants, chloroplasts are usually (but not always) inherited from the ---::mother (egg cell); chromosomal theory exception
^1667437173419

1. Importance
	1. Just a 3% improvement in reproductive rate would greatly increase num of animals and consequently production
	2. Increase in productivity and efficiency lowers cost
	3. Alter reproduction
		- Sometimes want to increase reproduction (ex endangered species)
		- Sometimes want to limit reproduction (feral cats)
		- Much easier to mess up reproduction than improve it
2. Terms
	1. Estrous Cycle = All physiological and behavioral changes from one ovulation to the next consecutive ovulation ([[Reproduction]])
	2. Menstrual Cycle in humans and primates is very different
	3. Estrus = Period of receptivity to be bred by the male
	4. Ovum = Female gamete
	5. Follicle = Involves the ovum and all the cells that support ovum development in an ovary
	6. Ovulation = Release of the ovum from the follicle
		- The follicle ruptures and the ovum is released away from the ovary
	7. Gestation = The process of prenatal development of an organism in the uterus
		- Chicken egg development does not occur in uterus, so never a fetus, always an embryo (incubation, not gestation)
	8. Parturition = The birth process
	9. Oviposition = The process of laying an egg (usually [[avian|avians]])
	10. Incubation = Embryonic development outside the body (usually [[avian|avians]])
	11. See chart for [[Animal-Specific Reproductive Info.png]]!
	12. Duplex = Two cervixes (Marsupials and rodents)
	13. Bicornate = Poorly to moderately developed uterine horns in mares and cows but highly developed in bitches, queens, and sows
		- Livestock, cats, dogs
		- Two ovaries, two oviducts, a single cervix, uterine horns, uterine body, vagina 
		- Ovaries
			- Two different functions
				1. Exocrine function = Production and release (ovulation) of ovum
					1. Follicle grows and grows, animal goes into estrus, exocrine occurs
				2. Endocrine function = Production and release of specific hormones
					1. Hormones are chemical signals that are designed to travel through circulatory system for communication (controlled by nervous system (faster) or endocrine system (slower))
					2. Estrogen (E2) = "Hormone of Estrus" (Involved w/ physiological and behavior changes that prepare for sperm transport and fertilization)
						- Prepares reproductive tract for potential gamete fertilization
						- From follicle cells
					3. Testosterone (T) = Required for ovum development
					4. Corpus Luteum = "Yellow body"
						- Develops from cells of follicle after ovulation
						- Produces Progesterone (P4) = "Hormone of pregnancy" (Prepares reproductive track for gestation)
			- Estrous cycle
				1. If a cow's cycle is 210 days, First the follicle grows and produces estrogen until it peaks and ovulation occurs (which breaks the follicle). Then, the corpus luteum grows and produces P4. If animal not pregnant, the corpus luteum and P4 goes away, follicle starts regrowing, and cycle restarts.
					1. Cows have multiple follicles, but only one ends up ovulation. "Follicle wars"
		- Oviduct
			- Between ovaries and uterotubial junction
			- May be called fallopian tubes
				 1. Extension of the uterine horns
			- Important for transport of both the ovum and sperm
			- Site of fertilization (combining male + female gametes (sperm + ovum))
			- Infundibulum = funnel from ovaries
			- Nutrition
				1. Oviduct fluid provides nutrients for the embryo while in transport to uterus
				3. In cows, embryo transport can take 3-5 days
		- Uterus (Horns and Body)
			- Transport
				1. In most species, sperm deposited in vagina and must get up to the oviduct
				2. Help sperm get from uterine body to oviduct by smooth muscle contractions
				3. Parturition process through smooth muscle contractions
			- Nutrition
				1. Provides embryo nutrients until placental attachment occurs
					1. Called uterine milk
				2. Placental attachment = embryonic tissues to attachment uterine wall
			- Site of Gestation
				1. Involves placental attachment
			- Endocrine
				1. Produces many hormones depending on species
		- Cervix
			- Protection of the uterine environment from potential pathogens
			- Contains folds that makes it easier to get things out than in
			- Located below uterine horns
			- Opens during estrus
				1. Produces high amounts of mucus during estrus that washes out
				2. Mucus provides lubrication and flows outward to protect from microorganisms trying to enter
				3. 90% of sperm may be washed out as well, but very high amounts so plenty can still make it
			- Opens during parturition 
				1. Dilation of cervix indicates how close parturition is
		- Vagina
			- Site of semen deposition in most species
				1. Exception is swine, which deposited in uterus 
				2. Semen = sperm + accessory fluids 
			- Located under the cervix
			- Also removal of urine
			- Tough internal tissues  
	14. Simplex = no cervix
		- Humans, primates
3. Estrus cycle
	1. Sperm and ovum are both haploid 
		- Have half of chromosomes
		- Embryo is diploid and contains both sets of chromosomes
		- Ovum has zona pelluie (shell)
			- Sperm combines w/ ovum and creates embryo
	2. Embryo
		- Starts dividing 
			- Cells get smaller as they divide 
		- Cells begin to specialize
		- The zona pelluiea still on outside surrounding inner cell mass
		- Tripoplast Cells within shell that become placenta
			- Eventually break out as placenta
	3. Placenta
		1. Has several layers
			- Amnion (inner)
			- Chorion (middle)
			- Allantois (outer)
				- Watery fluid in the outside layer
				- Ruptures first (water breaking)
		2. Chorioallantois = fused layers of placenta making up the outer sac
		3. Amnionic sac = makes up the inner sac
		5. Placenta attached to internal organism by ambilocal cord
		6. Uterine wall surrounds it all
		7. Functions
			- Exchange of products 
			- Hydraulic dampener
			- Parturition 
				- Cervical dilation
				- Lubrication

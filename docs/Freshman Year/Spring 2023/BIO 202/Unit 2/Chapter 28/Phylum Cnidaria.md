1. Kingdom Metazoa -> Phylum Cnidaria
2. Notable Traits
	1. Radial symmetry
	2. Diploblastic (ecto- and endo-)
		1. Ectoderm creates epidermis 
		2. Endoderm creates gastrodermis
		3. Both of these layers are in contact w/ water and rely on diffusion to meet oxygen needs and directly contact the food
			1. Contact w/ water
			2. No circulatory system
	3. Specialized tissues w/ specialized cells
		1. No organs
	4. GVC 
		1. Digestive system and circulatory system
		2. Single opening
	5. Cnidocytes
		1. Stinging cells
		2. Namesake
		3. Seen in all species
		4. Contains organelle called nematocysts
			1. Stinging organelle near the surface
			2. Coiled harpoon w/ thread like a tripwire that causes it to shoot outward
			3. Produces neurotoxins
				1. Target the nervous system to incapacitate prey (paralysis)
				2. Fast-acting
			4. Can range from painful to deadly for humans
	6. Mesoglea 
		1. Extracellular matrix found in cnidarians like coral or jellyfish that functions as a hydrostatic skeleton
	7. Nervous network
		1. Not centralized nervous system
		2. No directionality (radial symmetry and no clear head)
		3. Can stimulate touch
	8. Dimorphic body plan
		1. Two distinct phases or morphs
		2. Mesoglea
		3. Polyp is the sessile form
			1. Think sea anemone
		4. Medusa is the motile form
			1. Think jellyfish
		5. May spend more time in one than the other but all experience both at some point
	9. Colonial
		1. Ex: *Obelia*
		2. Gastrozoids for digestion
		3. Gonozooid for reproduction
		4. Seen on the same organism
	10. Solitary
3. Life cycle
	1. Cycles w/ both polyp and medusa forms
		1. Sessile vs mobile
	2. One dominant body plan
		1. Jellyfish = medusa is dominant
			1. Box jellies 
			2. True jellies
		2. Sea anemone and corals = polyp is dominant
	3. Monoicous & Dioicous
		1. Clear male and female ---
		2. Distinct male and female ---
4. Digestive System
	1. Incomplete
		1. Gastrovascular cavity w/ only one opening
	2. Water circulates and all tissues must be in contact w/ water
		1. Water acts as circulatory fluid
5. Life history traits
	1. Mostly marine
		1. Fewer freshwater cnidarians
	2. Thigmotaxic
		1. ---
	3. Basic senses
		1. Capable of detecting light
			1. Basic placement
		2. Rottefalia = sensory organs that detect light and gravity
			1. Position in water
	4. Carnivores 
	5. Sessile vs motile
6. Four Classes
	1. Kingdom Metazoa -> Phylum Cnidaria - Four Classes
	2. Class Anthozoa
		1. Means "flower animals"
		2. Sea anemones & corals
		3. GVC is divided into septa (compartments)
	3. Coral bleaching 
		1. Stressed out from chemicals or viruses
		2. Eject photosynthetic symbionts that kills them
			1. Mutual obligate relationship is broken 
		3. Miles of reef may be affected
	4. Class Scyphozoa
		1. Means "cup animals"
		2. True jellies
		3. Medusa form lacks velum
			1. Difference between Scyphozoans and Hydrodes 
		4. Can touch the bell 
			1. Stinging cells usually in tentacles 
	5. Class Cubozoa
		1. Means "box animals"
		2. Box jellies
		3. Have a pedalia
		4. Most deadly sting among the cnidarians
			1. Very dangerous 
		5. Can swim very fast
			1. Can move around better than most other jellies
		6. Death by Australian Box Jellies
			1. Australia has netting up to prevent big box jellies
				1. Can't keep out Irukandji
					1. Has meter long tentacles although its cap is very small
					2. Causes Irukandji syndrome
						1. Death, Headaches, Nausea, Extremely painful
					3. This is what kills people in Australia 
	6. Class Hydrozoa
		1. Means "Water animals"
		2. Called hydroids
		3. The medusa form has a velum
			1. ---
			2. A diagnostic feature of this class 
		4. Siphonophores
			1. A specialized group of hydroids
			2. ---
		5. Ex: Portuguese man of war 
			1. Tentacles are long and hard to see
7. Phylogenic Reminder #2 
	1. Kingdom Metazoa -> Eumetazoa -> Radiata

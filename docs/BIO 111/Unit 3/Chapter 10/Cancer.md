1. Cancer = unrestrained, uncontrolled growth of cells
	- Failure of [[Cell]] cycle control
	- The cells don't preform their normal functions while using up the body's resources
		1. Doing aerobic processes and taking nutrition - competing normally functioning cells 
		2. Like a parasite
	- Two kinds of genes can disturb the [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|cell cycle]] when they are mutated
		1. Tumor-suppressor genes
			- Like car brakes
				1. Car brakes have an emergency (backup) brakes
				2. Must have mutation in both "brakes" for cancer to occur 
			- Normally blocks gene expression
			- p53 plays a key role in G1 checkpoint
				1. p53 [[Protein]] monitors integrity of [[DNA]]
					- If [[DNA]] damaged, cell division halted and repair [[Enzymes]] stimulated
					- If DNA damage is irreparable, p53 directs [[Cell]] to kill itself (apoptosis)
				2. Usually prevents the development of mutated cells 
					- p53 is absent or damaged in many cancerous cells
						1. Both copies of tumor suppressor gene must lose function for cancerous phenotype to develop
						2. First tumor suppressor identified was the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb)
							- Predisposes individuals for a rare form of cancer that affects the retina of the eye
							- The retina can detect photons and focal point of image. When image directly on retina, image is sharp. Sometimes focal point is in front of or behind retina. If rental cells always growing and dividing, it can thicken.
							- Inheriting a single mutant copyof Rb means that the individual only has one "good" copy left
							- Rb [[Protein]] integrates signals from growth factors and role to bind important regulatory proteins and prevent stimulation of cyclin or CDK production
							- When a transcription factor binds to [[DNA]], it changes the general structure.
								1. Double helix is 2 nm in width. When [[Protein]] binds, it bends it. That can start transcription of that region or inhibit it.
								2. Unphosphorylated Rb binds to transcription factor E2F. E2F cannot bind the [[DNA]] and transcription is locked. [[Cell]] growth triggers the phosphorylation of Rb, which then releases E2F, which binds the DNA and turns on gene expression. This advances the cell cycle.
						3. The role of normal p53 is to monitor [[DNA]] and the supply of oxygen 
							- Hypoxia is a condition of reduced oxygen supply
							- If damage is detected, p53 triggers repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53 signals apoptosis. 
							- A [[Cell]] with an abnormal p53 [[Protein]] cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis. Cells with abnormal p53 can become cancerous.
							- See graphic
								1. Normal p53
									- [[DNA]] damage, Cell cycle abnormalities, and Hypoxia. p53 recognizes this and either initiates [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|cell cycle]] arrest, DNA repair, and [[Cell]] cycle restart or apoptosis
								2. Mutated p53
									- DNA damage, Cell cycle abnormalities, and Hypoxia. Damaged p53 means cell cycle continues and cells become cancerous. Mutated p53 does not arrest the [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|cell cycle]] so damaged [[Cell]] continues to divide.
		2. Proto-oncogenes
			- Like car accelerator 
			- Activates gene expression
			- Cancer genes are oncogenes
				1. Oncogenes can cause cancer
				2. Normal cellular genes that become oncogenes when mutated
			- Carcinogens = chemicals that mutate [[DNA]] resulting in cancer
			- Many proto-oncogenes encode receptors for growth factors
				1. Receptors found on cell surface or intracellular
					- Growth factors are often [[Cell]]-surface
				2. If receptor is mutated  in "on", cell no longer depends on growth factors 
					- Mutation changes tertiary structure of epidermal growth factor receptor
					- A carcinogen can mimic natural ligand then stimulate response of growth factor
					- Or the growth factor receptor can be mutated in such a way that it no longer needs a signal to be activated
						1. Radon can do this
			- Some encode signal transduction proteins
				1. Mutates intracellular [[Protein|proteins]]
			- Only one copy of a proto-oncogene needs to undergo this mutation for uncontrolled division to occur 
				1. Different from tumor-suppressors

Aerobic Respiration::Requires oxygen; Animals eat sugar and breath oxygen, expelling carbon dioxide and water and gaining energy
^1663201177570

Aerobic Respiration Formula::$C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy$
^1663201177579

Photosynthesis::Most life forms on earth get energy from sun (plants capture sunlight and herbivores eat plants then carnivores eat herbivores and decomposers digest plant and animal matter)
^1663201177585

Photosynthesis formula::$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$ (Same formula as aerobic respiration but in reverse)
^1663201177592

Metabolism::Total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism (Anabolic = expanding energy to build up molecules) (Catabolic = harvesting energy by breaking down molecules)
^1663201177600

Digestion::Breaking down protein to amino acids and complex sugars to simple sugars
^1663201177608

Biochemical pathways::Reactions occur in a sequence and the product of one reaction is the substrate for the next; Many steps take place in organelles

^1663370715594

Energy can be --- but cannot be created or destroyed::converted from energy form to energy form
^1663370715599

Delta G = Delta H - TS::Gibb's free energy change formula; Delta G = change in free energy in the product of a chemical reaction
^1663370715605

Positive Delta G::Products have more free energy than reactants; H is higher or S is lower; Not spontaneous (Requires input of energy and work must be done for reaction to occur); Endergonic
^1663370715612

Work::Force over a distance; W = Fd or W = mad
^1663370715617

Negative Delta G::Products have less free energy than reactants; H is lower or S is higher or both; Spontaneous (still may not be instantaneous); Exergonic
^1663370715623

Endergonic::Positive Delta G; Storing/gaining energy; Ex: chicken developing in an egg; photosynthesis
^1663370715628

Exergonic::Negative Delta G; Releasing/losing energy; Ex: fire, compost pile; aerobic respiration
^1663370715634

Exergonic reactions --- energy while endergonic reactions --- energy to proceed::release (a spontaneous reaction); require (not a spontaneous reaction)
^1663370715639

Activation energy::The energy required for a reaction to proceed; Can be lowered by catalysts 
^1663370715646

Catalysts::Lower activation energy to get product more quickly; Ex: enzymes; If exergonic, can release energy faster; Don't change final free energy or Delta G
^1663370715652

First law of thermodynamics::Energy cannot be created or destroyed; Can only change forms; Total amount of energy in universe remains constant; During conversions, some energy is lost as heat
^1663370715659

Second law of thermodynamics::Entropy (disorder) is continuously increasing; Energy transformations proceed spontaneously to convert matter from a more ordered/less stable form to a less ordered/more stable form; Liquid is more disordered than solid and gas more disordered than liquid
^1663370715666

Humans can convert chemical energy in food into --- while plants can convert electromagnetic radiation (light energy) from the sun into ---::kinetic energy; chemical energy
^1663370715671

ATP (bio)::Chief "currency" of energy that all cells use; Adenosine triphosphate is composed of ribose (5 carbon sugar), adenine, and a chain of 3 phosphates
^1663370744429

Chain of 3 phosphates in ATP::Key to energy storage; Unstable bonds; ADP = 2 phosphates; AMP = 1 phosphate (lowest energy form)
^1663370715679

ATP is the primary --- of the cell. It has an --- with three phosphate groups attached::energy currency; adenosine backbone
^1663370715685

ATP hydrolysis drives ---::endergonic reactions; Coupled reaction results in net -G (exergonic and spontaneous)
^1663370715691

ATP is not suitable for ---::fats and carbs better; Cells store only a few seconds worth of ATP
^1663370715696

The sodium-potassium pump is an example of ---. The energy derived from exergonic ATP hydrolysis is used to pump --- across the cell membrane::energy coupling; sodium and potassium ions
^1663370715702

ATP is a ---::nucleotide; ribose + adenine + gamma, beta, and alpha phosphate group
^1663370715708

ATP Cycle::ATP hydrolysis drives exergonic reactions as phosphates don't want to be together (all negatively charged); a coupled reaction results in net negative G
^1663370715714

Enzymes (bio)::Most are protein (some are RNA); Shape of enzyme stabilizes a temporary association between substrates; Enzyme not changed or consumed in reaction
^1663370744437

Carbonic anhydrase::200 molecules of carbonic acid per hour made without enzyme; 600,000 molecules formed per sec w/ enzyme
^1663370715722

Active sites::Pockets or clefts for substrate binding; Where molecule of interest (ligend) binds; Precise fit of substrate into active site of enzyme
^1663370715727

Enzymes do not change --- of reaction, just lowers the ---::free energy; activation energy
^1663370715734

Active sites apply stress to distort ---::the particular bond to lower activation energy (induced fit)
^1663370715739

According to induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo ---::dynamic conformational changes upon binding. The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction
^1663370715745

Competitive inhibitor::Competes for the same binding site thus inhibiting enzyme function; Affects initial rate but does not affect maximal rate, whereas noncompetitive inhibitors affect do
^1663370715752

Allosteric inhibition::Modifies the active sites of the enzyme so that substrate binding is reduced or prevented
^1663370715759

Allosteric activators::Modifies the active site of the enzyme so that the affinity for the substate increases
^1663370715765

Vitamins are important ---::coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes; Required for enzymes to function properly
^1663370715771

More oxygens in vitamins means --- whereas only hydrogens and carbons means ---::water-soluble; fat-soluble
^1663370715778

Fat soluble vitamins ---::A, D, E, K; Can be stored 
^1663370715784

Water soluble vitamins ---::B vitamins, C; Cannot be stored and excess released in urine
^1663370715791

Metabolic pathways::Series of chemical reactions converting things (Ex: cholesterol to vitamin D); The end product can often stop the entire biochemical reaction from working (Ex: if you have enough vitamin D, end product inhibits enzyme and more production)

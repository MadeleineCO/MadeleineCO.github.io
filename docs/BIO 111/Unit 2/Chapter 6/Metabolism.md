1. Aerobic Respiration
	1. Aerobic = requires oxygen
	$$C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy$$
		1. Eat sugar and breathing oxygen. Expel carbon dioxide and water and gain energy.
2. Photosynthesis
$$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$$
	3. Same formula as us but in reverse
4. Most life forms on earth get energy from the sun
	1. Plants capture sunlight and herbivores eat plants. Carnivores eat herbivores and decomposers digest plant and animal matter.
5. Metabolism
	1. Total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism
	2. Anabolic reactions/anabolism
		1. Expand energy to build up molecules
		2. Anabolic steroids
			1. Chemicals that stimulate anabolic reactions
			2. Performance enhancing drugs
	3. Catabolic reactions/catabolism
		1. Harvest energy by breaking down molecules
		2. Digestion
			1. Breaking down [[Protein]] to amino acids and complex sugars to simple sugars        
			([[Carbohydrate]])
5. Biochemical pathways
	1. Reactions occur in a sequence
	2. Product of one reaction is the substrate for the next
	3. Many steps take place in organelles

How do we get energy from proteins::Amino acids undergo deamination to remove the amino group and remainder (some num of carbons) is converted to a molecule that enters glycolysis or Krebs cycle; Alanine is converted into pyruvate after deamination; Aspartate is converted to oxaloacetate
^1664053411806

Nitrogenous waste::Most toxic form is ammonia, 2nd most toxic is uric acid (birds/reptiles), and 3rd is urine; Protein contains nitrogen, so part of nitrogenous waste is from protein catabolism
^1664053411815

In the Krebs cycle, the majority of --- is generated::CO2; NADH is also created and stored; FADH is another nucleotide made in the cycle
^1664053411821

3 C molecule called glycerol along with three fatty acids compose ---::Tryglyceride (lipid)
^1664053411829

Fatty acids are converted to ---::acetyl groups by Beta-Oxidation (Takes 2 C at a time from fatty acid tail to form acetyl groups that can be used in the Krebs cycle)
^1664053411835

Lipids are catabolized through ---::aerobic respiration (converted to acetyl groups through Beta-Oxidation)
^1664053411840

Glycogen from the liver and muscles, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together w/ fats and proteins, can feed the ---::catabolic pathways for carbs (Carbs and some amino acids and glycerol enter glycolysis) (Fatty acids and some amino acids are converted to acetyl groups then enter Krebs cycle)
^1664053411847

The cell membrane inhibits glucose (large, polor) from diffusion. How does it get inside cell?::Insulin binds to receptor on outside of cell, stimulating vesicle formation w/ transport protein unit called GLUT4 to create a glucose channel
^1664053411853

GLUT4::Glucose transporter stored in vesicles. Insulin binds to receptor causing GLUT4-containing vesicles to fuse w/ membrane so glucose can be transported into cell
^1664053411860

What prevents pathways such as glycolysis from being activated?::1st way is no glucose (no proper reactants); 2nd way is at the end of glycolysis, a little ATP is made (net 2) so if there is enough ATP, glycolysis does not need to occur
^1664053411866

An end product is often a signal for ---::if the pathway needs to run or not; Respiration must maintain balance between ADP and ATP, so glycolysis only occurs when there is an imbalance

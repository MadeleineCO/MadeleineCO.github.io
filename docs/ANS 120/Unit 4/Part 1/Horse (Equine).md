1. [[Domestication]]
	- Purpose for domestication (food)
		1. Purpose for domestication is always food first
	- Bred for transportation and draft
		1. Light - Hotblooded
		2. Draft - Coldblooded
		3. Inbetween - Warmblooded
	- Light, long legs for long stride
	- Domestication 5000-7000 years ago
		1. China and middle east region
		2. Intentional domestication 
			- First for food
			- Other purposes came later
		3. 2000 BC - battle
			- Riding and draft
			- Carts
		4. ---
	- Mustangs are *not* wild horses. They are feral.
		1. No free ranging wild horses in the US. Only feral horses.
		2. Prewalski wild horse is only wild equid close to horse that we still have
	- Warfare is considered horses greatest contribution to society
		1. Imposing civilization through warfare
	- First true domesticated horse thought to be Arabian
		1. Eventually became a breed through inbreeding and genetic selection
1. [[Herbivores]]
2. Terms 
	- ---
3. Horses and size
	- Measurement by the width of the palm
		1. Start from front leg to top of withers
		2. 1 hand = 4 in
		3. ---
4. Types of horses
	- Draft = cold blooded work horses; easy going
		1. Largest horses
		2. Suffix, Claidstale, Shire
		3. Designed for moving forward
	- Light = hot blooded; tempermental
		1. Bred for speed, agility, or endurance
		2. Quarterhorse known as sprinter 
		3. Arabian are endurace
		4. Thouroghbred
	- Gated = light but w/ different foot-fall pattern
		1. Noted for consistant footfall
		2. Most are 14.3-17h
		3. 1000-1500 lbs.
		4. Smooth gate and comfortable ride
		5. American saddlebred
		6. Tennesee walking horse
	- Warm bloods
		1. Crossing cold and hot
		2. Moderate frame (16-18h)
		3. Heavier boned
		4. Good at dressage and jumping
		5. Hanoverian, Dutch warmblood, Trakehner
	- Ponies = distinguished by height; hot and cold blooded variations
		1. Must be 14.2h or less at full size 
		2. 500-900 lbs.
		3. Most are for draft
		4. Shetland, welsh
	- Miniature horses
		1. 8.5-9.5
		2. Proportionally look more like horse than a pony
		3. Develop in 1600s in Spain
	- Other Equids
		1. Donkeys come from Africa
			- Other major equid
			- Associated w/ Jerusalem
		- Wild
			1. Zebra
			2. Wild donkeys
	- Total num of equids
		1. China
		2. Russia
		3. Mexico
		4. US
			- We don't use horses as much for draft
			- Often recreational
			- Num of horses dropped from early 1900s
				1. Replaced by motor vehicles and tractors
				2. Especially tractors
				3. Need for horses dropped more during WWII
				4. All time low at 1960
					- All work horses
				5. Horse num went up after 1960 due to interest in recreation
				6. 1986 - Tax Reform Act
					- Wealthy people built horse farms intended to lose money so that they didn't have to pay as many taxes
						1. Make money by losing money
					- Tax reform act ended this practice so horse num dropped some again
				7. Went up again in 2000 then dropped in early 2000s recession
				8. Horse businesses determined by amount of discretionary funds
					- In hard times, horses are first to go
				9. American pet services keeps track of pet numbers
6. Socioecology/Physiology
	- Type I = Social; Herd-bound
		1. Most types of equids
		2. Herds follow rain and forage
	- Type II = Solitary; Territorial 
		2. Grevy's Zebra (Imperial zebra)
			- Stallions establish territory
	- Corsorial = animals that live off speed
		1. Built for speed
	- [[Equine Anatomy & Physiology]]
	- Genetic Problems
		1. We propagate problems
		2. SCID - Severe Combined Immunodeficiency 
			- Simple recessive disorder
				1. One individual recessive gene
			- Lethal
				1. Like switch that turns immune system off
				2. Horses quickly die after birth from any bacterial/viral infection
				3. Most recessive lethals are less than 1-3% of population in the wild
					- However, we kept breeding heterozygotes 
						1. At some point, up to 40% of Arabians were carriers 
						2. We tend to not select against known genetic defects
				4. Lethal = dead whereas detrimental = severely impactful 
					- SCID is lethal

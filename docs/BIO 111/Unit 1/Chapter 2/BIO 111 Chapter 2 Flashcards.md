^1661562831098

Polarity of water::Within a water molecule, the bonds between O and H are highly polar (O is much more electronegative than H) This causes partial electrical charges to develop (O is partially negative δ– and H is partially positive δ+)

^1661562831163

pH:The negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration of solution

Acid::Any substance that dissociates in water to increase the [H+] (lowers the pH); The stronger an acid is, the more hydrogen ions it produces which lowers its pH
^1661562831171

Base::Any substance that combines with [H+] dissolved in water, and thus lowers the [H+] (increases the pH)
^1661562831179

Methyl::Linear shape; R - CH3; Nonpolar

Carbonyl:: Triangle shape w/ C in the middle surrounded by R (single bond), OH (single bond), and O (double bond); Charged, ionizes to release H; Since carboxyl groups can release H+ ions into solution, they are considered acidic

Amino: Triangle shape w/ N in the middle surrounded by R (single bond), H (single bond), and H (single bond); Charged; Accepts H+ to form NH3+; Since amino groups can remove H+ from solution, they are considered basic

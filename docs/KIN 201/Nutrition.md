	- Oils
	- Avoid processed foods 
3. Appropriate caloric intake
	- Depends on level of activity
		1. Very sedentary = 13 kcal/lbs. body weight
		2. Sedentary = 14 kcal/lbs. body weight
		3. Moderate activity = 15 kcal/lbs. body weight
		4. Very active = 16 kcal/lbs. body weight
		5. Competitive athlete = 17 kcal/lbs. body weight
		6. calorie = amount of energy required to heat 1 gram of water by 1* C
			1. Calorie = kilocalorie (kcal) 
4. Macronutrient recommendations
	- Carbohydrates
		1. Vital for brain and nervous system function
		2. Important source of energy during exercise
		3. Fiber
			- Non-digestible carb that helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol
			- Plays a role in healthy digestive function
			- Recommendation is 25-35g/day
		4. Recommendation = 45-65% of daily caloric intake
			- Might be different under certain conditions (ex athletes)
	- Fats
		1. Necessary for normal body functioning
		2. Important source of energy during rest and low-intensity exercise
		3. Saturated and trans fats

		3. Not typically used as a source of energy, but can be beneficial for recovery and adaption to exercise
		4. Recommendation = 10-15% of daily caloric intake

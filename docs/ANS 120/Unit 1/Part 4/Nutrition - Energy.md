1. [[Animal Nutrition]]
2. [[ANS Carbohydrates]] (simple (mono/disaccharides) and complex (polysaccharides))
	1. Monosaccharides (ex: glucose, fructose, galactose)
		- Monogastrics use glucose for energy, so glucose is primary carb substrate for ATP production in all monogastrics
			- Fructose and galactose are turned into glucose
			- Ruminants use glucose as well but have other opportunities (VFA's)
		- Disaccharides (ex: sucrose, lactose)
		- Polysaccharides (example: glucose polymers)
			- Starch (Stored energy in plants)
			- Cellulose (Main component of cell walls in most plants)
			- Glycogen (Carb stored in the liver and muscles in animals
			- Chemical digestion can break down starch and glycogen, whereas microbial digestion can do starch, glycogen, and cellulose ([[Monogastric]] vs. [[Ruminant]] and [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]])
			- [[Monogastric|Monogastrics]] use simple CHO's (glucose)
			- [[Ruminant|Ruminants]] and [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]] use simple CHO's but VFA's play primary role as energy substrate
				1. Ratio of CHO and VFA depends on feed, but mostly VFA
	2. Fats
		1. About 2.25x energy than that of carbs
			- More potential energy than carbs
		2. Fat sources include animals and plants
		3. Degree of saturation (level of double bonds) makes difference
		4. Fats go through beta-oxidation to be produced as ATP
		5. Uses include heat, sleeping, exercise/work, hibernation
	3. Energy is commonly the most limiting nutrient
		1. First concern when balancing a ration (bc assuming water is available)
		2. Cells all run on ATP
3. Where does energy go?
	1. Gross energy (GE; either fecal or digestible energy)
	2. Digestible energy (DE; either urine/gasses or metabolic energy)
	3. Metabolic energy (ME; either heat or net energy)
	4. Net energy (NE; to maintenance)
	5. Maintenance (to production)
		- Energy needed to stay alive
		- Basic metabolic/physiologic function
	6. Production
		- Ex: lactation
		- Anything beyond what the animal needs to stay alive
	7. Lose some energy at every step

1. [[Cell Communication]]
	- Receptors can be defined by their location
	- 2 types
		1. Intracellular receptor
			- Located within the [[cell]]
			- Steroid hormones
				1. Common nonpolar, [[lipid]] soluble structure
				2. Can cross the plasma membrane to steroid receptor inside the [[cell]]
					- Plasma membrane not a barrier to hydrophobic steroid hormones 
				3. Binding of the hormone to the receptor causes the protein complex inside cell to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
					- The [[protein]] is not anchored to a membrane
					- Often binds to [[DNA]]
					- Can act as regulators of gene expression
				4. Ex: cortisol (stress hormone)
					- Cortisone is drug that helps w/ pain
					- Not given very often because they last a while (do not break down in [[water]])
				5. Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their precursor, cholesterol 
					- Because these molecules are small and hydrophobic, they can diffuse directly across the plasma membrane into the cell, where they interact with internal receptors.
					- Estradiol and testosterone
						1. Estradiol (estrogen) has hydroxyl group whereas testosterone has just oxygen instead
						2. Cholesterol has hydroxyl group there and a tail with Hs and Cs
						3. Different functional groups
							- Names give clues as to structures
							- Di = two hydroxyl groups
							- Testosterone and cortisone have oxygen where cholesterol and estradiol have hydroxyl group
			- Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm. 
				1. Many intracellular receptors are *transcription factors* that interact with [[DNA]] in the nucleus and regulate gene expression.
				2. Can turn genes on and off
		2. Intercellular receptor
			- [[Cell]] surface receptor or membrane receptors located on the plasma membrane to bind a ligand outside the cell
				1. Transmembrane proteins in contact w/ both the cytoplasm and the extracellular environment
					- Beta sheet makes channel through phospholipid bilayer
					- Has tertiary structure on outside of channel where ligand can bind
			- Photons can be signal for plants 
				1. Stimulating signal
			- Sound waves can be signal for hearing
				1. Ear has transmembrane proteins
				2. Sound waves can physically push receptors and stimulate them
					- Receptors specific to different wavelengths
					- Neurons inside brain are sensitive to defined wavelengths
	- Subclasses of membrane receptors
		1. Chemically gated ion channels 
			- Channel-linked receptors that open to let specific ion pass in response to a ligand
			- Sodium is higher outside of [[cell]]
				1. Can open channel that allows sodium to enter
				2. Resting potential is the charge inside the [[cell]]
					- Common value is -60 mV
					- Naturally negative
					- When sodium enters, resting potential increases (less negative)
						1. Could eventually become positive
						2. Can depolarizing the [[cell]] towards zero and then can hyperpolarize in the opposite direction
						3. Called action potential
							- How nerves work
							- Neuron fires, influx of sodium, becomes less negative/more positive
							- After firing, the Na+K+ pump must pump ions out
				3. If sodium gate broken, paralysis occurs
		2. Enzymatic receptors
			- Receptor is an enzyme that is activated by the ligand
				1. Almost all are [[protein]] kinases
		3. G [[protein]]-coupled receptor (GCPR)
			- A G-[[protein]] (bound to GTP) assists in transmitting the signal from receptor to enzyme (effector)
			- G-[[protein]] = protein bound to GTP
				1. Guanine triphosphate (another nucleotide)
			- G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) = receptors bound to G-proteins
				1. G-protein is a switch turned on by the receptor
				2. Hydrolyzing a phosphate turns off receptor
					- Cutting phosphate off of GTP (makes GDP)
					- G-proteins have the intrinsic ability to hydrolyze 
						1. Can turn itself off after receptor turns it on
				3. G-[[protein]] then activates effector proteins (usually [[enzymes]])
				4. Single largest category of receptor type in animal cells is GPCRs
					- A worm has exactly 958 cells and >5% of proteins are GPCRs in these worms
					- Critical for animal cells
				5. G-protein provides link between receptor that receives signal and effector [[protein]] that produces cellular response
2. Kinases
	- Kinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates something
		1. Gets phosphates from [[ATP]] or GTP
	- Scaffold proteins
		1. Hold map kinases (kinases that stimulate [[cell]] division)
		2. Series of enzymes associated w/ each other so than when one protein is phosphorylated another is phosphorylated then another in a series
		3. One called map kinase kinase kinase (MKKK) that cascades to MKK then to map kinase (MK)
3. Intracellular key effectors (cascade of events)
	- Intracellular second messengers are chemical signals that cells say to do something quickly (lots in a chain of events)
	- Often, the effector proteins activated by G proteins produce a second messenger
	- Adenylyl cyclase
		1. Activated by G-protein
		2. Produces cAMP, which binds to and activates the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA)
		3. PKA adds phosphates to specific proteins
		4. When cAMP, cells must get things moving quickly
			- Binds to PKA which then phosphorylates other proteins downstream of it
	- Phospholipase C
		1. Name = Phosphorylation + lipid + enzyme
			- Associated with membranes (hence lipid part in name)
			- Takes membrane bound structure and reorganizes it to make other signaling molecules
		2. PIP2 is acted on by effector protein phospholipase C
		3. Produces IP3 plus GAG
		4. Both act as second messengers
	- After cleaving of phosphates from ATP, you get AMP then cyclic AMP (cAMP), which serves as a second messenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell (intracellular)
		1. Termination of the signal occurs when an enzyme called phosphodiesterase converts cAMP into AMP
		2. Caffeine interferes with this enzyme, so cells continue to be very active
			- Masks fatigue
	- The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second messengers
	- RAS proteins
		1. Small GTP-binding protein (G protein)
			- Can turn itself off
			- Active when GTP is bound and inactive when GDP is bound
			- Innate hydrolyzing capabilities
			- Heterotrimeric G proteins have A, B, and y subunits
				1. All linked together when inactive
				2. As ligand binds to receptor, GTP is plugged into the alpha (A) subunit, GDP --> GTP, causing alpha to separate from the betta gamma pair
				3. Then cellular response triggered either by alpha or beta gamma pair
				4. Hydrolysis then terminates the signal as GTP --> GDP
			- Cholera
				1. Massive diarrhea that dehydrates you 
				2. Unclean water
					- Cholera is a ligand and a toxin that binds to a G protein associated w/ receptor that can open a chloride channel in the intestines
					- Lumen = interior cavity
					- Chloride ions are then pumped into the intestines, causing water to follow the high concentration of the solute (CL-)
					- Toxin prevents G protein from shutting off so Cl- and water keeps pouring in
					- Diarreah --> dehydration --> death
		1. Link between the RTK and the MAP kinase cascade
		2. RAS protein is mutated in many human tumors, indicative of its central role in linking growth factor receptors to their cellular response
		3. RAS can regulate itself - stimulation by growth factors are short-lived
		4. Majority of cancers caused by mutation in this protein
			- When RAS can't hydrolyze or turn itself off
			- Cancerous tissues doesn't have normal specialized functions
			- Take resources normal cells need
4. Receptor Kinases
	- Kinases phosphorylate proteins to alter function
	- Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
		1. Tyrosine = amino acid
		2. Membrane bound protein 
			- Single pass transmembrane protein
		3. GPCR goes through membrane seven times
		4. Ligand binds and phosphorylation occurs
			- One RTK is stimulated to bind w/ another forming a dimer
			- Then they phosphorylate each other
				1. Tyrosines are one of amino acids that can be phosphorylated (one of three)
			- Causes downstream series of signals
		5. RTKs often associated w/ growth factors
			- Mutations in RTKs can cause cancer
			- Associated w/ RAS g protein
			- Carcinogens = chemicals that cause cancer
				1. Bind to receptors such as RTK when its not the normal ligand
				2. Stimulates RTK then downstream stimulates RAS and eventually gets to transcription factors that get activated
					- Transcription factors bind to DNA and affect gene expression
5. Phosphorylation
	- Kinases turn stuff on, but how do you turn things off?
		1. Phosphatase = enzyme that removes a phosphate from a protein
	- Only three amino acids that can be phosphorylated
		1. Tyrosine
		2. Serine
		3. Threonine
			- Extra methal group on threonine
		4. Any protein that must be phosphorylated will have one of these three at a specific location
		5. Primary sequence of a protein tells you the order of amino acids 
		6. Kinases are either serine and threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases
6. ERK = MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated
	- Translation = mRNA --> amino acids using ribosomes
		1. mRNA is single stranded, but if it forms a lop at the end, it cannot be read by ribosome
		2. Loop stops production until proteins are phosphorylated, removing the loop, and allowing proteins to be produced
	- Allows you to control when you can make proteins
		1. Controlling this is critical 
			- Apoptosis (aka programmed cell death)
				1. Times when you need your cells to die
				2. Intentional w/ positive outcomes
				3. 15 day-old mouse embryo has areas of tissue between the toas, which apoptosis eliminates before the mouse reaches full gestational age of 27 days
					- Humans have this web-like tissue as well that must be removed as fingers develop
7. Intercellular communication
	- Budding yeast cells can communicate by releasing a signaling molecule called mating factor 
		1. Communication between mother cell and daughter cell (asexual reproduction)
		2. Yeast can also exchange genetic material with other cells (sexual reproduction)
			- Mating factor is a ligand than can bind on receptor of receiving yeast cell
			- Stimulates this exchange of genetic info
	- Autocrine signaling
		1. Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins that can regulate gene expression
		2. When cell density is low, autoinducers diffuse away from cell
		3. When cell density is high, more autoinducers are present and bind to receptors that regulate transcription of certain genes that are responsible for production of autoinducers, resulting in a positive feedback loop
	- Cell-cell communication enables Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to work together to form a biofilm inside a hospital patient’s catheter. S. aureus is the main cause of hospital-acquired infections.
	- Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with the bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The luminescence makes it difficult to see the squid from below because it effectively eliminates its shadow. In return for camouflage, the squid provides food for the bacteria. Free-living V. fischeri do not produce luciferase, the enzyme responsible for luminescence, but V. fischeri living in a symbiotic relationship with the squid do. Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase enzyme.

1. [[Genetics and Heredity]] and [[Early Ideas on Heredity]]
	- Mendel's model of inheritance assumes that. . .
		1. Each trait controlled by single gene
		2. Each gene has only two alleles 
		3. There is clear dom-rec relationship bt alleles
	- Most genes do not meet this criteria
		1. Polygenic inheritance = multiple genes control phenotype
			- Ex: height, hair color, skin color
			- Show continuous variation and are referred to as quantitative traits
			- May see differences in frequencies of different phenotypes
				1. Heigh forms a bell curve
			- No discrete ratios
		2. Pleiotropy = one allele has more than one effect on phenotype
			1. Ex: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia. Multiple symptoms can be traced back to one allele
				- In sickle cell anemia, red blood cells have a bent shape that can't go through capillaries as easily. Causes muscles to not get good circulation and thus not enough oxygen. Then they preform lactic acid fermentation and become sore. You can have one copy or two copies of the mutated gene. In countries w/ malaria, having one copy can be beneficial bc you experience less fatigue from malaria and less severe than two copies. 
					1. All viruses are nucleic acid wrapped in protein. Scientists can modify HIV virus so that it doesn't make you sick. Instead, it brings in the correct form of the beta-hemoglobin chain. Inserts gene to make round cells. Cell then incorporates it and produces other cells with that gene.
				- Cystic fibrosis results in problems w/ CFTR pump for Cl ions. Can't pump Cl out of lungs so Cl draws in water through osmosis, mucus thickens outside lungs, and bacteria can accumulate and breathing problems.
		3. Incomplete dominance (blending inheritance) = the heterozygote is intermediate in phenotype between the 2 homozygotes
		4. Codominance = the heterozygote shows some aspect of both homozygous phenotypes
			- Ex: blood types (A blood, B blood, O blood, AB blood)
				1. Multiple alleles and 3 possible alleles of the I gene
				2. Difference between blood types
					- Sugars exhibited
						1. Can be linear or branched
						2. Such as Galactose for B
					- Different antibodies produced by different types (A can't mix w/ B bc of surface antibodies that would cause them to bind and coagulate. O has not surface antibodies so it is a universal donor)
					- I gene codes for glycoproteins on blood cells
						1. Creates different signatures on the surface of cells
					- See chart!
				1. RH factor genes can be + or -
					- + is dom and - is rec
					- If a pregnant woman has O- blood and the father is O+ then the child is O+ blood. Blood that is passing through placenta removes CO2, and the point where mother's blood and child's blood mixes, immune responses develop. The first child may be ok, but then the mother has antibodies for RH+ blood, so if second baby has O+ blood, the mother's antibodies attack it so may not survive.
		5. Multiple alleles determine some traits (more) than two possible genes at the same locus (specific street address for a gene on a chromosome)
			- Multiple alleles can all affect same site of chromosome
				1. Ex: fur color ---
		6. An individual hetero for four genes w/ a genotype of AaBbCcDd. Genes B and C are *linked* bc they are close together (see graphic)
			- Genes A and D assort independently (can cross over during meiosis) bc they are far apart
			- Possible gametes would be ABCD, ABCd, aBCD, aBCD (B always linked (like paired) with C) and AbcD, Abcd, abcD, and abcd (b linked w/ c)
			- The individual would not produce alleles w/ Bc or bC combos (always have either BC or bc since they are so close together)
		7. Some genes are found only on sex chromosomes (called "sex-linked" traits)
			- After Mendel studied peas, Thomas Morgan looked at fruit flies (only four chromosomes that are fairly large)
				1. Morgan could identify males vs females and noticed that red eyes were dominant but some white eyed flies. Not following normal pattern (3:1 phenotype). White eyed flies were usually male. The gene for eye color located on sex chromosomes.
			- Females are homo (XX) while males are hetero (XY)
				1. If you have one copy of a gene, it is expressed
			- Red green colorblindness is most common form. 
				1. More commonly found on men bc colorblindness is carried on X chromosome.
				2. Female carriers can pass on either colorblind copy or unaffected copy. If female passes on colorblind gene, males will have it and daughters will be carriers. If female passes on good gene, no one is affected (assuming father is normal)
		8. Epistasis = the products of different genes interact to influence the phenotype
			- One gene can interfere w/ the expression of another gene
			- Ex: pigment production only occurs when a dom C allele is present. If present, AA or Aa produces brown whereas aa produces black. If rec c, that allele interferes with the expression of all other genes so that no pigment is ever produced (white)
		9. Expression of some genes can be influenced by the environment
			- Ex: coat color in Himalayan rabbits and Siamese cats. An allele produces an enzyme (tyrosinase) that allows pigment production only at temperatures below about 33* C. Means that coat is darkest at extremities bc these are the coldest points.
				1. Proteins have optimal temps and pHs at which they work
			- Environment can be what you eat, what you are exposed to, etc.
				1. All cells must respond to environment.
				2. Cells can sunburn or tan depending on alleles in response to sun. Blond hair lightens. Hands form callouses. 
3. Probability - Predicting Results 
	- Rule of addition = the probability of an event that can occur in two or more independent ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of the different ways
		1. When crossing Pp x Pp, the probability of producing Pp offspring is probability of obtaining Pp (1/4) plus probability of obtaining pP (1/4). 1/4 +  1/4 = 1/2
	- Rule of multiplication = the probability that independent events will occur simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities
		1. When crossing RrYy x RrYy, the probability of obtaining rryy offspring is probability of obtaining rr (1/4) times probability of obtaining yy (1/4). 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16
	- Rules of addition and multiplication can be demonstrated using Punnett Squares
		1. Monohybrid and dihybrid crosses
			1. Understand phenotypic ratios
			2. Genotypic is looking for homo dom, hetero, or rec whereas phenotypic is looking for if it expresses dom or rec trait
		2. Trihybrid crosses are much more complex

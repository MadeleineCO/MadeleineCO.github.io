Two strategies available for breeders for genetic improvement are ---::mating systems and selection
^1678924205100

Over time, the desired effect of selection ---::cumulates; How did we go from ancestor of dog to many breeds? Both appearance and behavior can be changed via selection
^1678924205115

Selection::Man's most effective means to influence rate of genetic change; Allows us to use fewer animals to meet our food needs
^1678924205122

The rate of genetic change w/ selection depends on four factors, ---::heritability (h^2), selection differential, population size, generation interval
^1678924205130

The higher the heritability, the faster the rate of ---::change for selection; Greater h^2 = better selection
^1678924205138

Selection Differential::The mean value of selected individuals minus the mean value of the pop from which they were selected; X (individual) - mean of X (pop)
^1678924205146

The larger the selection differential, the --- rate of change through selection::faster; We select for extremes (greater differential)
^1678924205154

The greater the population size, the greater the ---::superiority for selection; Results in greater variation so more potential for genetic progress; Variation is the raw material for selection
^1678924205162

Generation interval::The avg number of years for turnover of a pop; Shorter = better for selection
^1678924205169

The smaller the generation interval, the --- the rate of change through selection::faster
^1678924205176

Gi Ex::If male is 24 and female is 22 by the time they have their first child, then the avg generation interval is 23 years 
^1678924205184

Basis for Selection (Sources of Info)::Individual performance records, Pedigree, Collateral relatives, and Progeny; Must be accurate data
^1678924205191

When you select a sire and dam, you are selecting them out of the pop w/ a ---::goal to change the pop over time; May use various sources of accurate info as your basis of selection 
^1678924205199

Individual performance records::Direct measuring of the animals of interest; Can record yourself; Most commonly used as a source of info for selection
^1678924205206

The value of individual performance is highly related to ---::h^2; Very good for *highly* heritable traits (ex growth traits such as WW, YW, ADG, and FE; carcass traits such as IMF, FT, and REA, and milk production traits such as MY, MF, and P%)
^1678924205213

Disadvantages of using individual performance records as basis for selection::Not good for sex limited traits (ex can't measure a bull for MY); Can't rely on individual performance for traits that require long time to appear (ex puberty); Can't measure carcass traits where animal must be slaughtered to take measurements; Low accuracy for *lowly* h^2 traits
^1678924205220

Pedigree (basis for selection)::Looking at ancestors to make predictions; How did the parents perform?
^1678924205226

Collateral relatives (basis for selection)::Looking at performance of siblings (ex how are related females performing?); Can look at both full and half siblings
^1678924205233

Progeny (basis for selection)::The best way to measure the genetic worth of an animal
^1678924205240

Accuracy of Selection::The relative reliability of estimates that we are using to make selection decisions
^1678924205248

Statistically speaking, the accuracy of selection estimates how accurately the genotype of the individual for a certain trait can be predicted from  ---::the phenotypic averages of its relatives
^1678924205255

The level of accuracy does not suggest the --- of an animal::net worth
^1678924205261

The accuracy of estimates will --- over time::change; More info improves accuracy
^1678924205268

US MARC::Research center in Nebraska that generates numbers annually for animals
^1678924205275

Estimating Breeding Value (for a single trait)::$EBV = \frac{h^{2}(x - x\bar{})}{h}$  X = individual performance; Bar X = mean of pop
^1678924205282

Why divide by two when estimating breeding value?::Half of genetic potential from animal X; Each parent contributes half to the next generation
^1678924205289

Ex: Post Weaning ADG::Must look at. . .h^2 (0.6), Selection differential (x - mx); Pop size; Gi; EPV = 0.6(3.5 - 3.0) / 2 = 0.15; EPD = 0.15 + 3.0 = 3.15; Gi = 0.15/5 = 0.03 lb/yr; Accuracy = sqrt(0.6) = 0.77
^1678924205295

Estimated Progeny Different::Different of progeny in comparison to avg of pop; EPD = EBV + mX; This should change little as it is affected by bull's genetics (static improvement)
^1678924205303

Progress/year equation::P/yr = EBV/Gi
^1678924205310

Common Gis::Horse = 8-12; Cattle = 4-6; Sheep = 3-5; Swine = 1.5-2; Chicken = 1-1.5
^1678924205317

Accuracy for individual performance::Based on one record; Accuracy = sqrt(h^2); The higher the heritability, the greater the accuracy
^1678924205324

Pedigree (basis for selection)::Information based on ancestor performance; Involves degree of relationship, h^2 of trait, Same env; Same methods to measure traits
^1678924205333

Degree of relationship when considering pedigrees::Parents = 1/2, Grandparents = 1/4, Great Grandparents = 1/8, As you move further up the pedigree, amount of genes in common reduces and they are less related
^1678924205340

When using pedigree as basis of selection, traits must be ---::measured in same way as ancestor; Ex: heart guard (circumference of heart) must be measuring in same spot in parent as in offspring
^1678924205348

[[2023-03-17]]
Advantages of Pedigree (basis of selection)::Cheap; Valuable for sex-limited traits (unlike IP) and traits expressed later in life; Good for *lowly* h^2 traits
^1679084988075

Attention to the records of --- increases accuracy of selection::ancestors (pedigree info)
^1679084988086

Disadvantages of Pedigree (basis of selection)::Lack accurate records/env influences of ancestors performance records (any mistakes can be costly); No comparative basis for selection among individuals that are all descendants of the same ancestor 
^1679084988093

Looking at pedigrees provides no comparative basis for selection among individuals that are all descendants of the same ancestor (like siblings) bc ---::they are expected to all have equal performance (not usually the case)
^1679084988099

Collateral Relatives::Using info from full sibs (same parents) or half sibs (one parent in common); More useful when dealing w/ full sibs
^1679084988106

Full sibs = --- related while half sibs = --- related::1/2; 1/4; Accuracy better if they share mother vs. father; Accuracy better if full
^1679084988113

Advantages of Collateral Relatives (basis of selection)::Good for sex-limited traits and traits that require slaughter to measure
^1679084988120

Accuracy when looking at collateral relatives tends to be lower than ---::individual performance; Exception = low h^2 traits bc increased num of observations
^1679084988126

Factors affecting accuracy of sib test (collateral relatives)::h^2 of trait; Relationship of sib (closeness); Number of sibs tested; Correlation between phenotypes of sibs
^1679084988134

Accuracy of collateral relatives is higher w/ more --- and in --- sibs::sibs tested; full
^1679084988140

Correlation between phenotypes of sibs affects --- info::collateral relative; Env correlation; Full sibs have same env from conception to weaning (more accurate); Involves G x E interactions
^1679084988148

Sibs (collateral relatives) are more accurate than individual performance if ---::low h^2 (with greater num of offspring (observations))
^1679084988155

Progeny Testing::The evaluation of the genetic makeup of an individual by phenotype of it's progeny; Looking at the performance of the progeny to rank the parents
^1679084988163

The best answer to the question of "genetic worth" of an animal is determined by --- testing::progeny; For both qualitative and quantitative traits
^1679084988170

[[2023-03-20]]
Progeny Testing w/ Qualitative Traits::Main objective = determine the likelihood that an animal is a carrier of a detrimental recessive allele
^1679344032027

Progeny Testing Ex: CID in Arabians::CID = combined immunodeficiency (AKA SID); In foals, passive immunity from mother wears off and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs) is meant to turn on foal's IS; IN CID, this malfunctions so foal gets infection and dies (lethal)
^1679344032034

CID is an autosomal --- trait::recessive; Both parents must be hetero for offspring to express this; We use locus test to prevent this; Causes foal to be susceptible to infection as maternal Ab wanes (>2 months, Ig levels decrease -> infection -> death)
^1679344032040

Factors affecting the "success" of progeny test for qualitative traits::Genetic make-up of test animal (genotypes available); Num of offspring that can be produce (more = better)
^1679344032046

Test Matings::Number of offspring required to determine the likelihood that an animal is *not* a carrier of a detrimental trait depends on type of potential cross
^1679344032051

When using test matings to determine likelihood that a parent is a carrier of a detrimental recessive allele, the more offspring, the ---::greater confidence that animal is not a carrier
^1679344032056

Sire x recessive (H_ x hh) Test Mating::Advantage = fewer matings required; Disadvantage = can be difficult to find homo rec dams
^1679344032062

Sire x heterozygote (H_ x H_) Test Mating::Advantage = dam is known carrier; Disadvantage = Must ID animals and more matings involved
^1679344032067

Sire x daughter Test Mating (H_ x H_)::Advantage = easier to obtain dam; Disadvantage = inbreeding depression and many progeny required
^1679344032072

Test Matings Graph::![[Pasted image 20230320182336.png]]
^1679351897839

Progeny Testing w/ Quantitative Traits::Major objective = determining BV of parents
^1679351897850

Offspring represent --- BV of parents::1/2; Basis for EPDs and EBVs; EBV = (h^2(x - mx)) / 2; EPD = EBV + mx
^1679351897856

EBV Equation::EBV = (h^2(x-mx)) / 2
^1679351897863

EPD Equation::EPD = EBV + mx
^1679351897868

Factors Affecting Accuracy of Progeny Testing for Quantitative Traits::Dams must be random; Offspring must be tested in the same env; Must compare parents of similar ages (another factor of env); Increased num of progeny = increased accuracy
^1679351897874

When Progeny Testing, offspring must be tested in same ---::env; Performance = G + E; Env is anything apart from genes; Must control for G x E interactions
^1679351897880

As h^2 increases, more progeny in PT required to equal accuracy of ---::individual performance; PT is better w/ low-mod h^2 while IP better w/ high h^2
^1679351897886

The net value of an animal is dependent upon several traits that may not be of ---::equal economic value; May also be independent of one another (or even inverse relationship such as MY and MF)
^1679351897893

Three basic methods for Selection for More than One Trait::Tandem (not used); Independent Culling Method (less used); Selection Index (most used)
^1679351897899

Selection for More than One Trait Ex: both BW and YW::Want BW to be low but YW to be high; Not possible to buy bull based on one single trait; But these traits may not be of equal economic value
^1679351897906

Tandem Method (>1 trait selection)::Allows you to focus on one trait at a time; Ex: may select for BW until you have animal w/ consistently low BW then begin to select for another trait; Old, inefficient method
^1679351897913

The tandem method involves selection for one trait, then ---::another, then switch focus to another. . .
^1679351897919

Problems w/ Tandem Method::May have opposing genetic relationship between traits; More traits = slower progress; Takes a long time
^1679351897925

Independent Culling Method::Still being used, but has stringent rules so may not provide the best animal overall; Creation of min standards and select for only those standards (culled if animal below min in any trait)
^1679351897932

Problem w/ Independent Culling Method::If animal fails one standard, must be culled; You may cull animals that are outstanding in other traits
^1679351897938

For a pig to be saved for breeding in ICM, must meet three standards: ---::1 - litter of >= 8 weaned; 2 - Weight >180 lbs at 5 months; 3 - <= 1.3 in of backfat at 200 lbs live weight
^1679351897945

Selection Index::Creates an index w/ weighted averages (like GPA for the animals); Some traits get more points (weight) than other traits (different degrees of emphasis on traits of interest); Then you make equation to determine genetic worth
^1679351897951

Selection Indexes create separate determination of values for each ---::selection trait; The addition of these values gives a total score
^1679351897957

The most widely used selection method for >1 trait is ---::selection index
^1679351897963

Selection Index Equation::I = b1x1 + b2x2 + . . . bnxn; I = Index value; b1 = weighing vector; x1 = single item of phenotypic info
^1679351897969

Indicators of better accuracy w/ progeny testing::More progeny; Greater h^2 (accuracy = sqrt(h^2))
^1679352313651

If table indicates that the relative accuracy of progeny tests as compared to selection on basis of individual performance = 1.22 (w/ h^2 on x-axis and progeny # on y-axis), then progeny test is ---::22% more accurate than individual performance for 10 progeny and h^2 = 0.3
^1679352313664

If table indicates that relative accuracy of progeny tests as compared to selection on basis of individual performance = 0.96 (w/ h^2 on x-axis and progeny # on y-axis), then progeny test is ---::-4% more accurate than individual performance for given progeny # and h^2; Or IP is 4% better than PT
^1679352313671

Looking at sibs is more accurate than IP if ---::low h^2
^1679352313678

The relative accuracy (compared to IP) of one full sib is --- regardless of ---::0.5; h^2
^1679352313685

[[2023-03-21]]
Selection Index Ex: Beef producer - cow/calf stocker::WW = 0.4 (500 and 200); Post ADG = 0.3 (.25 and 0.75); YW = 0.3 (1000 and 300); But must be put on trait ratio basis; 100 = heard avg and x/mx  x 100 = trait ratio
^1679442492946

The selection index refers to a single number that predicts the ---::BV of an individual for a weighted combination of traits 
^1679442492956

Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP)::An extension of SI; Simultaneous solution of num of equations using matrix algebra; Method of genetic prediction ( for selection), particularly appropriate when performance data comes from genetically diverse contemporary groups 
^1679442492963

Contemporary groups refers to differences in ---::env (ex age, herd); BLUP system corrects for these differences when making genetic predictions for selection
^1679442492970

Keys fer Selection Based on >1 Trait::Genetic relationship among traits (+ or -  and  strength); Number of traits selected for; h^2 of traits 
^1679442492976

The more traits you are trying to select for, the ---::slower the progress 
^1679442492981

If traits are highly h^2, you can --- select for >1 trait::easily; Cannot select for many traits if lowly h^2
^1679442492987

Correlated response::When you select for one trait and experience improvement or decline in another trait; Must be considered when selecting for >1 trait
^1679442492994

The major trait of importance in dairy selection is ---::milk production; Looking at feet, udder, stature, etc. all geared towards this one goal
^1679442492999

--- is the leading breed when it comes to ---::milk yield; Other breeds include Jersey (highest % fat), Guernsey, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, and Milking Shorthorn
^1679442493005

Traits geared towards milk production (chart)::![[Pasted image 20230321193129.png]]
^1679442493011

Higher volume = increased fat, which is measured by ---::volume; Liter of Holstein milk vs Liter of Jersey (J tends to produce higher concentration of fat)
^1679442493016

--- is an important trait to select for so cattle don't hurt you::Temperament
^1679442493022

Specific traits selected for in dairy::Milk Production (high importance, mod h^2); Fertility (high importance, low h^2); % fat (mod importance, mod/high h^2); Type (mod importance, mod/high h^2); Temperament (mod importance, mod h^2); Calving ease (mod importance, low h^2)

^1679442493038

% fat is --- important and expresses --- h^2 (dairy selection)::mod; mod/high
^1679442493045

Type is --- important and expresses --- h^2 (dairy selection)::mod; mod
^1679442493051

^1679442493075

Genetic Correlation w/ Milk Production::Fat Yield = +0.75; % fat = -0.40; Type traits = weak, positive; Reproduction = probably negative
^1679442493083

Milk Production Graph over Time::![[Pasted image 20230320103412.png]]
^1679442493091

Crossbreeding is hardly used in --- operations::hardly used; If it is used, used from standpoint of trying to improve repro (which is low h^2 so high heterosis)
^1679442493098

Milk production is first objective in dairy selection so --- is hardly used::crossbreeding; In lbs of milk, Holstein is superior; In % milk fat, Jersey is superior; Mixing decreases both (not helpful)
^1679442493106

Comparison of Pure Holsteins to 1st Generation Crosses in Seven CA Dairies (chart)::![[Pasted image 20230321194129.png]] Reveals that crossbreeding mostly leads to reproductive benefits but not milk production improvements
^1679442493114

The --- is the major source of genetic improvement in dairy::sire; Can produce more offspring than dam
^1679442493121

We can select sires of sires, dams of sires, sires of dams, or dams of dams but most genetic progress made by ---::selecting based on sires (very little progress by selecting based on dams)
^1679442493128

Why is selection based primarily on sires? (even when all important traits are sex-limited)::Greater num of progeny vs dams; AI allows for even larger num of progeny (45% of operations have no bulls); Selection based on close female relatives and progeny testing of offspring to overcome sex-limited challenge
^1679442493135

We select sires based on --- in dairy::PTAs (Predicted Transmitting Ability); Comparison of individual to the avg of the population
^1679442493142

PTAs Ex: Select Sires Red Holstein Lineup::![[Pasted image 20230321194629.png]]

^1679442493167

[[2023-03-23]]
Factors Leading to Ultimate Success of Dairy Industry::*Record systems* based on comparisons of contemporaries on a similar basis; Limited num of traits selected; Adoption of technology
^1679624105968

Genomic selection::Allows people to estimate BVs by creating a GEBV (Genomic Estimating Breeding Value) based on DNA
^1679624105979

Genomics is defined as the ---::large-scale use of DNA info to estimate the genetic merit of cattle
^1679624105984

Genomic selection includes knowledge of differences in --- of individual cattle::DNA sequences; Can associate those differences w/ performance (locations become markers that indicate performance differences between individual and other cattle)
^1679624105990

Genomics summarizes a genetic map of what traits the animal ---::inherited from each of its parents (includes combination of PA and genotypic data to provide more reliable results)
^1679624105995

Example of genomic PTAs and bulls (graphic)::![[Pasted image 20230322102713.png]]Full sibs expected to perform similarly but genomics can determine if one will perform better than the other (like magnifying glass); Rank from best to worst = C, A, B
^1679624106001

AI in Dairy::Many operations do not have bulls and rely on female synchronization
^1679624106007

Dairy uses --- control to optimize production::environmental; Striving for top-notch health programs, nutrition, facilities, equipment, etc; Modifying env to fit animal (beef is opposite)
^1679624106012

bST::Bovine Somatotrophin; Growth hormone that acts as major regulator of milk production; Naturally occurs in cows and humans 
^1679624106018

Administration of exogenous bST (Posilac) can increase ---::milk production
^1679624106024

bST shares relationship w/ ---::IGF-1 (another growth hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1); Adequate nutrition = increased IGF-1 and MP; Inadequate nutrition = no change in IGF-1 and MP
^1679624106031

bST causes no detectable difference in ---::milk composition; Does correlate w/ increased incidence of mastitis, but if you adjust for increase in MP, incidence of mastitis not increased (highly productive animals have higher rates of mastitis in general)
^1679624106037

Cervical Vertebral Malfunction was first discovered in Holsteins in 1999 in --- herds::Danish, USA, UK, Netherland, and Japanese; Pedigree records traced disorder to Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell (bull)

Packer (beef infrastructure)::Slaughter and packaging; After feedlot; Then goes to consumer area of infrastructure
^1679799587427

Beef infrastructure has different --- at every phase::goals; Pushing animals in different directions whereas dairy only focused on one major goal (MP)
^1679799587433

Major Differences (Beef) From Dairy::Producer goals/objectives differ; Different env and availability of natural resources; More traits of economic importance; No centralized record-keeping system; Slower adaption to tech; High level of crossbreeding
^1679799587437

Unlike in dairy, beef producer goals/objectives differ::Dairy has one goal (MP); Beef goals include producing one calf per yr, good carcass meat, growth traits, etc.
^1679799587443

Unlike in dairy, beef has different environments and availability of ---::natural resources; Best animals are those that adapt to your specific env the best; We have temperate animals, tropical animals, etc.
^1679799587448

Unlike in dairy, beef has more traits of economic ---::importance; Selection for more traits in beef than in dairy; Many subtraits as well; More traits = slower rate of selection progress; Lack of vertical integration
^1679799587454

Beef experiences a lack of --- integration::vertical; Everyone is running their own operation
^1679799587459

Vertical Integration::One company controls all the different levels of production; Ex: poultry meat industry; Minimizes variation and removes middlemen (greater efficiency); Not seen in beef
^1679799587464

If there is a positive genetic correlation between traits, then --- rate of selection progress::faster; If negative, slower progress; Bc beef selects for many traits, this can make it more difficult
^1679799587469

Genetic correlation table for beef::![[Pasted image 20230324103127.png]]Negative correlation in repro (less genetic ability); WW at weaning time is just one; Carcass grade switches from negative at BW to positive at WW
^1679799587474

Differences between dairy and beef (slide)::![[Pasted image 20230325225030.png]]
^1679799587481

Fertility/Repro Traits Selected for in Beef::Calving Ease; First service conception; Heifer pregnancy; Rebreeding rate; Stayabilitiy; Days open; Daughter pregnancy rate; Scrotum Circumference; Wee look at these to rank bulls
^1679799587487

Growth Traits Selected for in Beef::Birth Wgt; Weaning Wgt; Yearling Wgt; ADG; FE (ratio of amount of grain per unit of feed); Hgt at Withers
^1679799587493

Carcass Traits Selected for in Beef::Intramuscular fat; Fat thickness; Ribeye area; First two are measures of marbling
^1679799587499

Beef has no centralized --- system::record-keeping; Each major breed association has own published sire summary (unlike DHIA, which keeps extensive dairy records to compare breeds); Each AI organization has own sire formats based on info from each breed association
^1679799587504

Problems w/ Beef Performance Records::Sire summaries don't mean semen or bull is available (AI < 13%); BV's calculated within breed only (cannot compare breeds); G x E interactions dramatically alter performance
^1679799587510

Dairy industry has embraced --- selection::genomic; Improves accuracy; Not used much in beef bc of small herds and part-time ranchers
^1679799587515

Only --- of beef operations use AI::13%; Used much more in dairy
^1679799587521

High level of crossbreeding in --- herds::beef (unlike dairy)
^1679799587526

Across-breed EPD Adjustments::Most useful to commercial producers *purchasing bulls* for use in *crossbreeding programs*; Must be careful and buy bulls w/ numbers you want
^1679799587531

Across-breed EPD Adjustments calculates a table that is produced every year by the ---::US MARC; Use the table to make adjustments for when you want to buy bulls
^1679799587537

Across-breed EPD Adjustments emphasizes ---::uniformity for rotational crossbreeding (want uniform offspring), divergence for terminal crossbreeding, and divergence of BW EPDs for bulls to breed to first calf heifers (prevent dystocia)
^1679799587542

Accuracy of across-breed EPD depends on accuracy of --- EPD for the bull::within-breed
^1679799587548

Individual performance accuracy formula::A = sqrt(h^2)    . . .(or A = h)
^1679866687043

EPD = ---::EPV + mX
^1679866687057

EPV = ---::h^2(x - mx)  /  2
^1679866687064


Expected Average Change = ---::EPV / Gi
^1679866687072

Progeny testing is most accurate with --- h^2 traits while individual performance is better for --- h^2 traits::lowly; highly
^1679866687078

Why is accuracy of selection based on the record of one full-sib always one-half as accurate as individual performance regardless of h^2 of the trait?::Full-sibs have 1/2 their genes in common with the individual
^1679866687086

Why is the accuracy value for one-half sibs lower than one full-sib?::Half siblings are less genetically similar than full-sibs (1/4 of traits in common vs 1/2)
^1679866687093

What is the EBV of a bull for WW (h^2 = 0.4) if he is in the top 6% of the herd? The herd average WW is 560 lb w/ a standard deviation of 35 lb.::Top 6% is two SDs from population avg (95% of pop = 2 SD and 99.5% = 3SD); 560 + (35 + 35) = *650*; EBV = 0.4(650 - 560)/2 = *14*
^1679866687100

[[2023-03-28]]
Angus is 0.0 for all across-breed stats on the table bc all comparisons for other breeds are ---::made against Angus; Angus is the baseline
^1680055580967

Ex of across-breed stat - 2.9 for Hereford BW::You could expect an addition of 2.9 lbs for Hereford calf compared to Angus
^1680055580978

Deleterious alleles should be heavily ---::selected against; If possible, you can use genetic testing (screening against carriers)
^1680055580989

Ex of selecting against deleterious alleles - Tibial Hemimelia in Shorthorn cattle::Causes severe, lethal deformities in calves (rear legs w/ fused joints, large abdominal hernias, skull deformity); Autosomal recessive; ASA requires all AI sires, donor, dams and cloned animals to be tested for TH (maintain list of "free" and "carrier" animals)
^1680055580997

Curly Calf Syndrome::Found in Angus (linked to bull called *GAR Precision 1680*); Causes curved spine, extended and contracted limbs, and "thin" appearance; Autosomal recessive
^1680055581005

Developmental Duplication (Polymelia)::Found in Angus; Causes calves to be born w/ extra limbs (although this can also be caused by embryo env); Incomplete penetrance
^1680055581013

Jonathan Beever (U of III.) geneticist found commonality in genes associated w/ --- in calves compared to normal calves::developmental duplication; Genetic testing indicates that 3% of US sires are *carriers* and breed wide freq of 6%
^1680055581020

The concern w/ developmental duplication carriers::Dd x Dd = 25% chance of dd; High death rate among dd individuals, *but* complication = incomplete penetrance (sometimes animals do not exhibit duplication); Important to perform genetic tests to determine if they simply do not show phenotype
^1680055581028

We have started using genetic testing for traits other than ---::deleterious alleles; Ex: homo vs hetero polled or homo vs hetero black (some angus are red but you can test for coat color)
^1680055581036

Genetic Testing and Tenderness Markers::Especially important to predict meat quality; Calpain gene is and indicator of more tender meat; Called *MAS* (Marker Assisted Selection)
^1680055581043

Good Side of Beef Selection (Compared to Dairy)::Many economic traits w/ high h^2 and are not sex-limited; Many traits easily measured; Recognition of value of performance records and EPVs
^1680055581051

Many economic traits have high h^2 and are not sex-limited in the --- industry::beef (unlike dairy); High h^2 = faster selection (offspring expected to look more like parents); Can measure many of traits in both sexes (BW, WW, carcass, etc.)
^1680055581058

Many traits are easily measured in the --- industry, including --- traits::beef; carcass; Can use indicator traits for those you cannot directly measure; Consolidation of packing industry (boxed beef, standardized carcasses, consistent future changes)
^1680055581066

Keys to Success in Beef From a Genetic Standpoint::Recognition of value of performance records and EBV's (dairy has less extensive records); Recognition/identification of breeds that excel in certain characteristics; Selection; Adjusted WWs; MPPA
^1680055581073

The recognition of value of performance of records and EBVs has improved the --- industry::beef; Dairy does not make as much progress w/ less extensive records; Without records, nothing to work with; Must learn what they mean and how they are determined
^1680055581080

The recognition and identification of breeds that excel in certain characteristics has improved the --- industry::beef; Must know which breeds work well in which env; Not one breed fits all
^1680055581088

When using selection, you should avoid ---::fads and short-term outlooks; Determine herd objectives and select breeds compatible to your objectives and env; Use objective measures for selection (records)
^1680055581095

Adjusted Weaning Weights::Purpose is to account for variations in wgt between animals that should be weaned at one time; Animals not all calving at same time but you want to measure WW at same time; Animals also come from diff breeds, mothers, environments etc. so must correct for differences
^1680055581102

Adjusted Weaning Weights use and --- factor::adjustment; Accounts for all sources of variation (such as genetic (cow/calf) variation, age of calf, breed, age of dam (older cows = heavier calves), sex of calf (males grow faster (sexual dimorphism))
^1680055581109

ADJ 205 days = ---::(actual wgt - birth wgt) x 205 + birth wgt / age in days; There are also equations to account for sex and calf and maternal env and age of dam
^1680055581116

Most Probable Producing Ability (MPPA)::Accounts for cows w/ diff num of records; Repeatability = estimates prob of repeated documented performance in future
^1680055581123

Repeatability::Estimates prob of repeated documented performance in future; Refers to expression of same trait at diff times in the life of same individual; Repeatability = h^2 + maternal env
^1680055581131

Repeatability = ---::h^2 + maternal env; r = repeatability
^1680055581138

[[2023-03-30]]
Repeatability is always higher than --- bc it accounts for maternal influence of cow that can be documented by previous ---::h^2; calf performances
^1680226665988

MPPA = ---::HA + nr/(1 + (n - 1)r) x (CA - HA); n = num of records for each individual; r = repeatability estimate for one record; HA = herd avg; CA = cow avg
^1680226665993

MPPA Formula::$MPPA = HA + \frac{nr}{1 + (n -1)}(CA - HA)$

Equine selection is the least studied of livestock because. . .::other animals are raised for for food purposes while horses are used for recreation
^1680385967650

Difficulties w/ Equine Selection::Long Gi, Long gestation, Long age to puberty (3-4 yrs), Only one offspring/year, Lack of accurate records
^1680385967657

Problems determining h^2 horses::Tremendous env variations; Racing - track surface, condition, age, training level, nutrition
^1680385967664

h^2 = ---::vg / vp; As vp (env variation) changes, h^2 is affected; Vp = Vg + Ne; Causes problems when determining h^2 in horses

^1680385967694

Fertility in horses::Very low h^2; Avg live foal crop estimate lowest among livestock (% of foals that will be born live (not lost pregnancy /stillborn / death shortly after birth)); Ovulation near end of estrus - must know when to breed; Artificial birth date
^1680385967701

Duration of estrus/time of ovulation in horses::From a management perspective, must know when to breed; Estrus duration = 5-7 days and ovulation occurs around 24hr before end of heat (must breed at end of heat)
^1680385967709

Artificial birth date in horses::January 1st; Must be born within the year to compete w/ age group but the earlier, the more training time (but horses are long-day breeders); Reduces fertility success

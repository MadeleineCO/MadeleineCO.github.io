1. Each three consecutive bases on the mRNA is a code word (codon) that specifies an amino acid
	1. The genetic code consists of 64 codons
	2. Three codons act as signal *terminators*
		2. Stops the tRNA from bringing the next amino acid
		3. UAG
		4. UGA
		5. UAA
	3. *AUG* codes for methionine, and it is also the *start signal* for translation
2. There are twenty amino acids
	1. Memorize the names (not the structures)
	2. ![[20-Common-Amino-Acids.webp]]
	3. Amino acids are like the "bricks" or building blocks of proteins
3. Translation = synthesizing a protein from amino acids, according to the sequences of teh nucleotides in mRNA
	1. Occurs at the ribosome in the cytoplasm of the cell
	2. Ribosomal RNA, or *rRNA* is needed for protein synthesis
		1. Helps mRNA bind to the *ribosome*
		2. Ribosomes have a small subunit (30s) and a large subunit (50s)
			1. mRNA binds to the 30s part
			2. *Ribosomes* are sites of protein synthesis
			3. rRNA joins w/ a number of proteins to form ribosomes
	3. Transfer RNA, or *tRNA*, brings specific amino acids to the ribosome to be assembled as proteins
		1. tRNA is like an adapter molecule
			1. Has four ends
				1. Amino acid binding site
				2. Charging enzyme binding site
				3. Anticodon binding site (pairs w/ codon on mRNA)
					1. Ex: if rRNA says UAC, then mRNA says AUG, the start codon for Met,  which would be attached at the amino acid binding site
				4. 50s ribosomal subunit binding site
		2. Transfer molecule that carries a specific codon to a ribosome
		3. 80 nucleotides long
		4. Folded
		5. Each tRNA recognizes the correct codon on the mRNA molecule
	4. Steps of Translation
		1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and migrates to the ribosome
		2. mRNA binds to small ribosomal subunit
		3. tRNA brings an amino acid to the ribosome, where the anticodon on the tRNA binds to the codon of the mRNA
			1. Ex: tRNA finds AUG on mRNA (anticodon is UAC and met is attached to tRNA)
		4. The amino acid bonds to its adjoining amino acid to form a growing polypeptide molecule
		5. The tRNA without the amino acid is released from the ribosome
		6. Other tRNA's bring amino acids to the ribosome to complete the protein molecule
		7. Terminates when a stop codon is reached

4. Proteins and Protein Synthesis Summary
	1. *Amino acids* are the repeating sub-units of protein molecules
	2. Amino acid order determines the protein
	3. 20 amino acids exist in all life forms
	4. Order of amino acids is important, and it determines the three-dimensional shape of the molecule
	5. *Structure* of the protein determines its *function*
	6. ![[Pasted image 20230123104602.png]]
	7. Genomic Geography
		1. In Cell Nucleus: RNA is produced by transcription.
		2. RNA is single-stranded; substitutes the sugar ribose for deoxyribose and the base uracil for thymine
		3. Messenger RNA or mRNA, conveys the DNA recipe for protein synthesis to the cell cytoplasm.
		4. mRNA binds to ribosome, each three-base codon of the mRNA links to a specific form of transfer RNA (tRNA) containing the complementary three-base sequence.
		5. This tRNA, in turn, transfers a single amino acid to a growing protein chain.
		6. Each codon directs the addition of one amino acid to the protein. Note: the same amino acid can be added by different codons; in this illustration, the mRNA sequences GCA and GCC are both specifying the addition of the amino acid alanine (Ala).
	8. Important Points
		1. Both DNA and RNA have a direction: one end is the 3’ the other is the 5’ end.
			1. Thus, codons are read in one direction only.
		2. Also, note there is redundancy in the genetic code
			1. Different sequences can specify for the same amino acid.
			2. Ex:  CUC, CUA, CUG = Leucine
5. When things go wrong
	1. Issues can arise during DNA replication
	2. *Mutations* = changes in the DNA sequence that may be passed along to future generations
		1. Not all mutations are bad
	3. *Point mutations* = a single base substitution
		1. Ex: THE CAT SAW THE **R**AT -> THE CAT SAW THE **H**AT
		2. Synominous mutation is a mutation that doesn't change the AA due to redundancy 
		3. Nonsynominous mutation is when the mutation does change the protein
	4. *Deletion* = when a small DNA segment is lost
		1. Deletion can change the reading frame
	5. *Insertion* = when a segment of DNA is added
		1. Insertion can change the reading frame
	6. *Frame-shift mutation* = the modification of the reading frame after a deletion or insertion, resulting in all codons downstream being different

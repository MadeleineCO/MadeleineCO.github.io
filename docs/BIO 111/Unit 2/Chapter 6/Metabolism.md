1. Aerobic Respiration
	1. Aerobic = requires oxygen
	$$C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy$$
		1. Eat sugar and breathing oxygen. Expel carbon dioxide and water and gain energy.
2. Photosynthesis
$$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$$
	3. Same formula as us but in reverse
4. Most life forms on earth get [[energy]] from the sun
	1. Plants capture sunlight and herbivores eat plants. Carnivores eat herbivores and decomposers digest plant and animal matter.
5. Metabolism
	1. Total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism
	2. Anabolic reactions/anabolism
		- Expand energy to build up molecules
		- Anabolic steroids
			- Chemicals that stimulate anabolic reactions
			- Performance enhancing drugs increase muscle mass
		- Dehydration synthesis
			- Create bonds and by losing water molecule
	3. Catabolic reactions/catabolism
		 - Harvest energy by breaking down molecules
		- Digestion
			- Breaking down [[protein]] to amino acids and complex sugars to simple sugars        
			([[Carbohydrate]])
		- Hydrolysis
			- Adding water molecule to break bonds
		- A covalent bond is composed of two elections, containing potential [[energy]]
			- If formed, energy is stored and if broken, energy is released
6. Biochemical pathways
	1. Reactions occur in a sequence
		- Can convert cholesterol into Vitamin D through a series of reactions 
			- Different series of reactions can make testosterone out of cholesterol
			- Or different series can make a stress hormone
			- Many different reactions for different outcomes
	2. Product of one reaction is the substrate for the next
	3. Many steps take place in organelles
7. [[Energy]]

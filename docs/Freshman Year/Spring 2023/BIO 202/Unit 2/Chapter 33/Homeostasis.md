1. Homeostasis = the maintenance of stable internal steady state
	1. Equilibrium (may adjust up/down)
	2. Set point (Tep, pH, blood pressure, etc.)
	3. Involves hormonal regulation
		1. Initiated by neurohormones released by the brain
		2. These stimulate hormonal glands
	4. Negative feedback loops
		5. Once a problem is detected and body starts fixing it, negative feedback is required to stop
		6. Ex: Body Temp
			1. Sensory cells detect increased temp
			2. Hypothalamus induces sweat
			3. BT decreases from evaporative cooling
			4. Reach set-point BT
			5. Stimulus is removed 
			6. Equilibrium is maintained
		7. Ex: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and blood volume
			1. Thicker blood = higher blood pressure
			2. Pituitary gland releases more ADH when dehydrated to signal kidneys to concentrate urine
			3. Once water content of blood is normal
				1. ---
	5. Positive feedback loops (not homeostasis)
		1. No PFL part of homeostasis
		2. Meant to feedback onto themselves into something happens
		3. Ex: milk production
		4. Ex: oxytocin, uterine contractions, and labor
			1. Oxytocin causes smooth muscle lining the uterus to contract -> Baby pushes  against cervix causing it to stretch -> Stretching of cervix causes more nerve impules to be sent to brain -> Brain stimulates posterior pituary to release oxytocin

1. Chapter 12 discusses Mendelian genetics 
	- [[Early Ideas on Heredity]]
	- [[Genetics and Heredity]]
	- [[Extensions to Mendel]]
	- Mendel did not know about genes. Just making observations.
		1. By early 1900s, aware of genes and chromosomes
			- Sutton and Boveri both proposed that genes are present on chromosomes in early 1900s
			- Observed that homologous chromosomes pair w/ each other during meiosis
			- Further evidence was provided by work w/ fruit flies (Drosophila spp.)
				1. Could get multiple generations of fruit flies within a year
			- Developed theories about chromosomes and linkage
2. Chromosome theory
	- Chromosomal theory of inheritance = Inheritance patters of unlinked vs linked genes
		1.  Linked genes do *not* segregate randomly during meiosis
	- Sex determination in Drosophila fruit flies is based on the num of X chromosomes
		1. 2 Xs = female
		2. 1 X = male
		3. In humans, it is based on the Y chromosome
			- 2 Xs = female
			- 1 Y = male
				1. SRY gene associated w/ testosterone 
					- Like first domino of genes that leads to development of maleness
					- Point in early development where embryo has differentiated cells 
						1. Adjacent cells communicate
						2. At about 6 weeks, the embryo has tissue that will become gonad tissue (bipotential tissue bc could become male or female)
						3. SRY gene starts production of male hormones (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT))
							- DHT is associated w/ male pattern baldness
		4. Birds don't have X and Ys
			- Males have two Zs
			- Females have Z and W
		5. Across many species, testosterone and estrogen are used as sex hormones
		6. In many [[organisms]], the Y chromosome is greatly reduced or inactive
			- X-linked genes are present in only 1 copy in males but 2 copies in females
			- One X is so condensed in females that information is not accessable
			- Sex-linked traits = controlled by genes on the X or Y chromosome; show inheritance patterns different than those genes on autosomal chromosomes 
				1. Most traits are autosomal traits (on autosomes)
				2. Colorblindness
				3. Father determines sex of offspring bc have either X or Y sperm while mother can only have eggs w/ X chromosome
				4. Morgan's fruit flies
					- Wild type = dominant allele/phenotype
						1. Wild type fruit fly has red eyes
					- Red-eyed female and white-eyed male gave F1 generation both red and white eyed flies but white eyed flies were all male
						1. Not normal 3:1 phenotypic ratio
					- Testcross: F1 female x F2 white eyed male showed that white eyed females were possible and viable
						1. Any time you testcross, you use known recessive individual (white eyed male) x unknown (either homo dom or hetero female)
						2. Showed that female white eyed were possible as well as white eyed males
				5. Hemophilia
					- Problem w/ blood clotting
						1. Normal enzyme activity not correct to start clotting when a blood vessel damaged 
						2. Likely to bleed longer
					- Present in British royal family
						1. Queen Victoria was carrier. One of her sons had hemophilia.
						2. Female carriers w/ male expressers 
		4. Dosage compensation = ensures equale gene expression even through females have 2 Xs and males only have 1
			- Barr body = in female [[cell|cells]], 1 X is inactivated and highly condensed
			- Females are heterozygous for X-linked genes are genetic mosaics (expressing the dominant allele in some cells, the recessive allele in other cells)
				1. Calico cats have barr bodies
					- Two different alleles on Xs (orange and black)
					- In some [[cell|cells]], black is tightly packed so orange is expressed. In other cells, orange is tightly packed so black is expressed.
3. [[Human Genetic Disorders]]

Phylogenetics::The study of ancestor and descendent relationships; Biogenetics helps us understand relationships
^1674770793034

Phylogeny::Building the evolutionary history of relationships between organisms or a group of organisms
^1674770793044

Phylogenic tree::A visual representation of phylogeny; Like a visual hypothesis; Rooted vs unrooted
^1674770793052

Rooted phylogenic tree::Hypothesis is that there is a common ancestor of all the organisms in the tree
^1674770793059

Unrooted phylogenic tree::Represents no connection to a shared common ancestor
^1674770793067

Root::The start of a phylogenic tree; Branches come off of the main root; A leaf is like a species
^1674770793073

Sister taxa::When branches come off at the same point; phylogenic tree
^1674770793080

Basal taxa::Early and unbranched; Phylogenic tree; The baseline
^1674770793088

Polytomy::A branch w/ two or more taxa; Phylogenic tree
^1674770793094

Trait descriptors - Ancestral::Not primitive; Very old or ancient traits
^1674770793101

Trait descriptors - Derived::Not advanced; Ex: mammals derived from early tetrapods
^1674770793108

Trait descriptors - Shared::Shared traits between multiple species; Everything above the trait on a phylogenic tree share it
^1674770793115

Sympatric speciation tends to reinforce disparities between ---::males of two species that rely on sexual selection to successfully mate.
^1674852698926

Which of the following would favor formation of a stable population of hybrid organisms created from reproduction of two distinct species?::Fusion of species A and species B over multiple generations
^1674852698937

Habitat isolation barrier ex::One fruit maggot fly lays eggs on apples while the other lays eggs on blueberries in the same area
^1674852698944

Temporal isolation barrier ex::Reproduction of species A occurs in fall while repro of species B  occurs in the winter
^1674852698951

Mechanical isolation barrier ex::Mating between species A and species B is initiated but the reproductive structures do not align properly
^1674852698957

Behavioral isolation barrier ex::Successful mate selection of species A and species B depends on elaborate mating calls and displays of mates
^1674852698964

Gamete isolation barrier ex::Protein coating of species A sperm is different than species B, which prevents cross fertilization when both gametes of both sexes are available
^1674852698971

So-called despeciation would result from the loss of two species when they ---::form viable (and fertile) hybrid offspring.
^1674852698977

--- speciation via polyploidy is more likely to occur in --- because asexual reproduction allows the new species to reproduce::Sympatric; plants
^1674852698984

Biological species is best defined as the --- of organism that may interbreed and produce --- offspring.::same kind; viable
^1674852698990

Phenotypic variation in the finger prints of humans is an example of --- genetic variation that has no perceived selective advantage.::neutral
^1674852698997

We discussed peppered moths in more detail because evidence of microevolution, caused by human activity, has been observed in this species. During one sampling event, you determine the recessive allelic frequency and want to estimate the genotypic frequency of homozygous recessive individuals in the population. Which variable below represents *homozygous recessive* individuals in the Hardy-Weinberg Equation?::q^2

[[2023-01-28]]
Close proximity doesn't mean the animals look alike (limitations of phylogenetic trees)::Ex: frog vs lizard vs rabbit - Lizards and rabbits are more closely related even through they look more different than a frog and a lizard
^1674935513007

Branches are not time scaled (limitations of phylogenetic trees)::No indication of how much time has passed in the tree
^1674935513021

Convergence traits across taxa (limitations of phylogenetic trees)::Ex: flight in mammals vs dinosaurs - no single ancestor of all flighted organisms; Analogous traits and convergent evolution
^1674935513030

Ancestral groups still thrive (limitations of phylogenetic trees)::All animals adapted to their env independent of how ancestral or derived they are across time
^1674935513037

When looking at phylogenetic trees, the --- of traits is informative::order
^1674935513046

Systematics::Organizes life based on evolutionary relatedness 
^1674935513054

Taxonomy::"To arrange"; Unique, Universal, and Stable; Internationally recognized; Uses binomial nomenclature (Linnaeus); Taxon/taxa all looks at group(s) of related organisms (taxon = refers to one group; taxa = multiple groups of related organisms)
^1674935513062

Hierarchical Classification System::Did (Domain) -> King (Kingdom) -> Phillip (Phylum) -> Cry (Class) -> Out (Order) -> For (Family) -> Good (Genus) -> Spaghetti (Species); Inclusive to Exclusive: DKPCOFGS; Everything seated below related to that which is seated above
^1674935513070

Domains::Prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea); Eukaryotes (Eukarya)
^1674935513077

Kingdoms::Protista (Unicellular), Plantae (Photosynthetic), Fungi (Decomposers), Animalia (Consumers)
^1674935513086

Supergroups::Between Domain and Kingdom; DNA -> reclassification -> protists; The more diverse your group, the more in-between categories you need (such as superclass)
^1674935513092

Homologous structures::Determine similarities between groups; Anatomically similar structures that were inherited from a common ancestor; Ex: Mammalian forelimbs (humorous, ulna and radius, metacarpals and phalanges)
^1674935513099

Analogous structures::Also called *homoplasy*; Anatomically similar structures w/ no direct evolutionary connection; Originated independently multiple times (convergence); Ex: wings for flight (within all animals and mammals, exact wing design is different, function is same)
^1674935513106

Tree of Life::Many branches/offshoots; Complex arrangements; Clearly links all life together; Uses phylogeny
^1674935513113

Why study phylogeny?::Trait evolution; Coevolution = symbiotic relationships develop (ex butterflies and plants); Mode and pattern of speciation (allopatric vs sympatric); Biogeography; Geographic origins; Age of different taxa; Nature of molecular evolution; Disease epidemiology
^1674935513120

Cladistics (phylogenic relationships)::Classifying organisms by looking at homologous traits
^1674935513128

Clade (phylogenic relationships)::A group of organisms at different hierarchical levels w/ shared evolutionary relationship; Must be monophyletic
^1674935513135

Monophyletic group::Includes an ancestor and all of its descendants; Best for our understanding of phylogenic relationships
^1674935513142

Paraphyletic group::Includes ancestor and some, but not all of its descendants; Monophyletic is better for our understanding of phylogenic relationships
^1674935513149

Polyphyletic group::Includes two convergent descendants but not their common ancestor; Ex: flight through convergent evolution
^1674935513156

Paraphyletic::Ex: reptiles and birds - past data put reptiles separate from birds but current data suggests that birds and reptiles are more related than we originally thought; Saurospida based on skull morphology that birds and reptiles share
^1674935513164

Polyphyletic::Ex: convergence on endothermy by birds and mammals but common ancestor was endothermic
^1674935513172

Pleomorphism::Shared ancestral trait (could be ancestral or derived depending on point of reference); Ex: all mammals have hair - does presence of hair make a primate different or better than other mammals? no, it's a pleomorphic trait
^1674935513179

Synapomorphies:: Shared derived traits that originated in the last C.A; Indicates monophyletic group; Ex: hair is a synapomorphy trait compared to reptiles but pleiomorphic within mammals; Ex: placental mammals 
^1674935513186

Synapormorphic trait vs pleiomorphic trait depends on ---::point of reference; Ex: vertebrate is a pleiomorphic trait within mammals and reptiles but Synapormorphic trait compared to our closest invertebrate animal
^1674935513193

Parsimony::Simplest explanations are preferred (fewer variables to explain a phenomena); Used in mathematical models
^1674935513201

When relating parsimony to phylogenetics, trees w/ --- steps are best::fewer; Tree w/ fewest steps to describe relationship; Ex: camera eye in octopus vs vertebrates; If homologous, 5 instances of trait loss but if convergent, 2 instances of trait gain (convergent is parsimonious bc fewest variables); Ex: whale evolution - whale ancestor that had legs then lost them is the simplest explanation

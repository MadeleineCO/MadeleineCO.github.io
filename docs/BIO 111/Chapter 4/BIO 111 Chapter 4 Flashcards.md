Cellular theory::All organisms are composed of cells; Smallest living things; Arise from only pre-existing cells
^1662220106236

Infection can change structure::Causes cells to act differently; Enlarged nuclei cells; Presence of HPV increases chances of cancer; Proportions of cells have consequences
^1662220076742

When cells look different ---::they act different
^1662220076755

Prokaryotic Cell::No membrane bound nucleus; DNA not defined by a membrane (collectively called nucleoid DNA instead of nucleus DNA); No well defined organelles
^1662220076763

Shapes of prokaryotic cells::Spherical (Cocci), rod (Bacillus), spiral (Spirilla)
^1662220076771

Two types of prokaryotes::Archaea (in unusual environments; heat tolerant proteins); Bacteria (ex: e-coli)
^1662220076779

Common characteristics of prokaryotic cells::Ribosomes, plasma membrane (boundary made up of phospholipids), cell wall (made up of carbs); locomotion (ex: flagella), cytoplasm (like water inside a water balloon; limits size)
^1662220076786

Surface (plasma membrane) area to volume (cytoplasm) relationship::Volume increases on a logarithmic scale (10 fold increase in volume to surface area); Why cells must be small
^1662220076792

Eukaryotic cells::Possess a membrane-bound nucleus; More complex than prokaryotic cells; Compartmentalizes many cellular functions within organelles and the endomembrane system
^1662220076797

In eukaryotic cells, DNA never leaves the nucleus, but --- does::RNA
^1662220076803

Eukaryotic cells possess a --- for support and to maintain cellular structure::cytoskeleton (gives organism its form)
^1662220076808

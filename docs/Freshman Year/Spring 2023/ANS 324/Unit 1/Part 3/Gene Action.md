1. Gene Action = How the genotype of a particular trait affects the expression of the phenotype
	1. Life is not as simple as [[Mendelian Genetics]]
	3. Types of gene action
		1. Non-additive = When the effect of one gene overrides the other
			1. Involves "major genes"
			2. Complete Dominance = One allele of a pair can mask the expression of the other (recessive)
				1. Ex: Primary coat color in Hereford and Angus cattle
					2. Angus = black is dom to red
					3. Hereford
			3. Incomplete Dominance = where the heterozygote produces a different phenotype
				1. Like blending of the dom and rec genes
				2. Ex: Shorthorn cattle
					1. Genotype RR = Phenotype red
					2. Rr = roan
					3. rr = white
					4. Rr x Rr
						1. Genotypic ratio = 1 RR: 2 Rr: 1 rr
						2. Phenotypic ratio = 1 red: 2 roan: 1 white
			4. Recessive expression = homozygous condition
			5. All genes are qualitative or quantitative
				1. Qualitative = "few genes"
					2. One or two genes
					3. Ex: coat color, horned/pulled, many genetic disease phenotypes
					4. Limited effect of environment
				2. Quantitative = "many genes"
					1. Many genes, sometimes even thousands, control the trait
					2. Ex: reproduction, milk production, growth traits, carcass traits, quality traits
					3. Greatly influenced by environment
						2. G x E Interaction
							1. Genotype by environment interaction
							2. E = everything but the genes
								1. Ex: nutrition, housing, medical care, etc.
			6. Epistasis = Interactions between non-allelic genes
				2. Different genes determine how other genes are expressed
					1. Gene to gene, not allele to allele
				3. The phenotypic effect of genes at one locus is dependent upon what alleles are present at another locus distinct from the first locus
					1. Plural = loci
				4. Complete epistatic and incomplete epistasis 
				5. Ex: complete dominance epistasis in wool pigmentation of sheep
					1. Alleles at one locus (W and w) control pigmentation of wool fibers
						1. W is completely dominant
						2. For pigmentation to occur, the recessive allele w must be present
						3. If individual has one copy of W, white wool appears (no pigmentation)
						4. B = black and b = brown
						5. F1 = BbWw (white sheep)
							1. black male x white female
							2. Prescence of W is completely epistatic to pigmentation (B or b)
						6. F2 = BbWw x BbWw
							1. 16 different outcomes
							2. 9 B-W- = white
							3. 3 bbW- = white
							4. 3 B-ww = black
							5. 1 bbww = brown
							6. 12:3:1 ratio of white to black to brown
				6. Recessive epistasis
					1. B = black, C = melanin production
						1. Prescence of C allows melanin production
					2. bb = brown, cc = no melanin (albino)
						1. Homo rec interferes w/ all pigmentation
					3. Dihybrid cross
						1. BbCc x BbCc (black rabbits)
							1. 9 B-C- (black)
							2. 3 bbC- (brown)
							3. 3 B-cc (albino)
							4. 1 bbcc (albino)
							5. 9:3:4 genotypic ratio of black to brown to albino
				7. Incomplete dominance epistasis
					1. Also called no dominance
					2. Ex: coat color in horses
						1. B- = bay, CC = color
						2. bb = chestnut, Cc = diluter
						3. Types
							1. CCB- = bay
							2. CcB- = buckskin
							3. Ccbb = palomino
							4. CCbb = chestnut
							5. cc-- = cremello
		2. Additive = When the effect of one allele adds to the effect of another to determine the phenotype
			1. Infinitesimal model of gene action
		3. Sex-linked = Genes that are carried on a sex chromosome
			1. Can be X-linked or Y-linked
				1. X chromosome has more genes than the Y chromosome
					1. Most traits are x-linked bc the Y chromosome has very few loci identified as controlling traits unrelated to the sex of the individual
					2. Trait controlled by locus on K chromosome = relationship with inheritance of sex
					3. Sex determined by inheritance of entire chromosome 
				2. Dominant or recessive
				3. Sex linkage is concerned w/ inheritance of traits of alleles that are usually on the X chromosome
				4. Ex: color-blindness, pattern baldness, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cat coat color (calico example), chicken feathers
				5. Ex: color in cats
					1. B = black and b = orange
					2. X-linked black cat is purebreeding when mated to similar blacks 
						1. Offspring will all be black
					3. Orange to orange is also purebreeding
					4. Blacks and oranges intermated
						1. Offspring may end up tortoiseshell (codominance of black and orange alleles)
							2. Must classify kittens by sex and color
						3. Male takes the coat of the mother while females are torts
							4. This is evidence that the trait is controlled by locus on X chromosome
							5. Cat must have both black and orange alleles to be tort, but this only occurs in females (two X chromosomes)
							6. Males only have a single X chromosome
								1. Only single allele at the color locus
					5. Tort females will produce litters of different constitutions, depending on the genotype of the mate
					6. XBXB = black female
					7. XBXb = tort female
					8. XbXb = orange female
					9. XBY = black male
					10. XbY = orange male
					11. If you cross a female tort w/ an orange male:
						1. You get 1/2 orange, 1/2 black males and 1/2 tort and 1/2 orange females
				6. Barr bodies result in calico cats
					1. Only one X is expressed
						1. Random in cell 
					2. Creates orange and black patches in heterozygote females 
					3. Piebalding effect = responsible for the expression of white fur 
			2. Recessive sex linked 
				1. Characteristic pattern of inheritance
				2. Unaffected parents produce daughters that are normal but 50% of sons of hetero females will show the recessive phenotype
				3. Females can inherit sex-linked recessive trait, but to express the trait, must be homo rec
					1. Means her sire must have allele to pass on
				4. Genotypes
					1. XAX = normal
					2. XaXa = colorblind
					3. XAY = normal
					4. XAY = colorblind
					5. XAY mated w/ XAXa
						1. Males = 50% normal, 50% colorblind
						2. Females = all normal
		4. Sex-limited = Traits that can only be expressed by one sex
			1. Ex: milk production, egg-laying trait, Cryptorchidism
				1. Milk genes carried in males but cannot be expressed
				2. Roosters carry but do not express egg-laying traits
				3. Cryptorchidism = when the testical does not descend into the scrotum 
					1. Only seen in males but females can carry genes
			2. Expression of a trait occurs in only one sex
		5. Sex-influenced = When the expression of a trait is determined by the sex
			1. Ex: horned/polled in sheep, presence of scurs in cattle
				1. Horned is dominant in male but polled is dominant in female
					1. Hh ram = horned 
					2. Hh ewe = pulled
				2. Prescence of scurs in cattle = dominant in male but recessive in female
					1. Scurs are small horn-like structures
					2. Ss male = scurs are present
					3. Ss female = scurs are not present 
			2. Inheritance of a trait appears to be different in two sexes even when they have the same genotype
				1. Expression of a trait differs for males vs females 
2. More Concepts on Gene Action
	1. Pleiotropy = when one gene affects more than one trait
		1. Leads to genetic correlation between traits 
			1. Correlation also occurs in gene linkage
		3. If you select against gene A, you may end up affecting several traits
	2. Variable expressivity = the existence of more than one grade of a trait
		1. The level of expression changes 
		2. Ex: skin color
	3. Overdominance = interactions between gene alleles resulting in a heterozygote that is superior to either homozygote for a particular trait
		1. AKA Extreme heterozygote
			1. Heterozygote advantage
		2. Ex: Sickle Cell Anemia
			1. In areas w/ malaria, heterozygote is superior (protected against malaria + no SCA)
	4. Incomplete Penetrance = When not all animals w/ a particular genotype exhibit the corresponding phenotype
		1. Not every individual that carries the gene will express that gene
		2. Ex: Polydactyly
			1. Extra toes or fingers
			2. Not every individual w/ the polydactyly gene expresses it 
				1. Ex: 6 out of 60 = 60% so incomplete penetrance
			3. Seen in fowl, humans, dogs, and cats
	5. Complete Penetrance = When every individual w/ a particular genotype exhibits the corresponding phenotype
	6. Lethal & Detrimental Genes
		1. Lethal = Results in embryonic death or death shortly after birth
			1. A few days, weeks, or months after birth
			2. Absence of the genotype/phenotype suggests that the genotype is lethal
				1. Ex: Platinum foxes -> Pp x Pp
					1. F1 = 2 platinum:1 silver (2Pp: 1pp)
					2. Suggests that homo dom is lethal
		2. Semi-lethal = Results in death before puberty
			1. Ex: Comprest
				1. Shorter dwarfism in cattle
					1. HH = normal
					2. Hh = comprest (slow growth/poor development)
					3. hh = semi-lethal (death before puberty)
			2. Predictable
		3. Detrimental = Results in reduction in some measure of fitness or productivity
			1. Ex: Albino Giraffe
				1. Anti-social behavior
				2. High attrition (ease of detection)
	7. Gene Linkage = Condition where non-allelic genes (different traits) consistently travel together through meiosis and syngamy
		1. Leads to genetic correlation
			1. Pleiotropy also causes genetic correlation in a different way 
		2. Two loci are linked if they always occur on the same chromosome
		3. Entire homologous chromosomes are separated at meiosis 
			1. Genes are the same chromosomes *tend* to end up in the same gamete
				1. Exception to this is crossing over during meiosis
					1. Crossing over = Reciprocal exchange of chromosome segments between homologs
						1. Mutual breaks occur at identical sites on each chromosome
						2. Chromosome fragments are exchanged
					2. Recombination = Formation of new combination of genes on a chromosome as a result of crossing over
					3. Multiple cross over events are common
					4. The probability of recombination of genes at any two linked loci depends on the distance between the loci
						1. Crossing over occurs more often between distant genes than genes that are close together
						2. Genes that are close together and cross over together are *linked*
	8. Additive Gene Action = The effect of one gene adds to the effect of another gene to determine the phenotype
		1. Seen with quantitative traits
			1. Many genes involved in the expression of the trait
				1. Quantitative traits are polyfactorial
			2. Expression over continuous range of values
				1. Ex: Milk Production, Carcass Merit
			3. Each gene contributes a certain amount towards phenotypic expression
		2. Heritability (h^2)
			2. Proportion of genes expected to be passed from parent to offspring that contribute to the expression of that trait
			3. h^2 is a measure of *additive gene action*
				1. Equations
					1. Vbv = breeding value
					2. Vgcv = gene combination value
					3. Broad sense heritability = h^2 = Vg / Vp
						1. Not as reliable so better to use narrow sense heritability
						2. Ratio of genetic variance to phenotypic variance
						3. h^2 = Vg / Vp = (Vbv + Vgcv) / (Vg + Ve)
					4. Narrow sense heritability = h^2 = Vbv / Vp
						1. Measure of the strength of the relationship between performance (phenotypic value) and breeding values for trait in a population
						2. Better to use as geneticists bc it does not include gene combination value
			4. If trait is highly heritable. . .
				1. Animals w/ high performance tend to produce high performing offspring 
				2. Animals w/ low performance tend to produce low performing offspring
				3. High = 0.41-0.99
				4. Medium = 0.21-0.4
				5. Low = 0.01-0.2
			5. If trait is not very heritable. . .
				1. Performance records of parents reveals little about progeny performance
		3. Some traits show no phenotypic differences (not heritable) even though genetically determined
			1. Ex: number of legs in a dog
				1. Genetically determined but not heritable
				2. Leg length in dogs is a heritable trait w/ genotypic and phenotypic differences

1. [[Cattle (Bovine)]] & [[Dairy]]
	- Grades
		1. Based on quality and sanitation parameters
			- Somatic cell count (SCC) = white blood cells plus some epithelial cells
				1. If elevated, likely an infection
			- Bacteria level
			- Indirect measure of cow health and quality
		2. Grade A - Can be used for any dairy product
			- <100,000/ml of bacteria
			- <750,000/ml of somatic cells
			- >90% of all dairies
			- Fluid or "Manufacturing"
		3. Grade B - Only used for processed products 
			- Not fluid milk
			- >1,000,000/ml of bacteria
			- <1,000,000/ml
		4. South has greater num of sick cows because hot + humid
			- More parasites
			- More difficult to keep cows healthy
	- Classes
		1. Fluid milk (30%)
		2. Soft products (14%)
			- Yogurt, ice cream, etc.
		3. Cheese (42%)
		4. Butter (14%)
	- Processing
		1. Pasteurization 
			- Purpose is to destroy potential pathogens in milk
			- Flash heating (160 degrees F for 30 sec)
			- Destroys bacteria, viral agents, protozoa, hormones
			- Done via a water bath
			- Some cheese is pasteurized and some isn't 
				1. Pasteurization allows you to control the types of bacteria
			- Dramatically changes taste of milk
		2. Homogenization 
			- If it wasn't homogenized, fat layer forms as it separates 
			- The process of breaking fat molecules into microscopic pieces
				1. Takes much longer to coagulate
2. Milk Composition
	- Water (87%)
	- Lactose (5%)
	- Fat (3.5%)
	- Casein (protein) (2.8%) 
	- Minerals (Ca and P) (0.7%)
	- Albumin (protein) (0.5%)
	- Everything necessary for offspring to grow 
		1. Ca and P main components for bones

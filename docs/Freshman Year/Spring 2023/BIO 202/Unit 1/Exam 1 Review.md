1. Hardy Weinberg
	1. p = frequency of dominant allele
	2. q = frequency of recessive allele
	3. Equation for gene pool: p + q = 1
	4. p^2 = frequency of homo dom
	5. 2pq = frequency of hetero
	6. q^2 = frequency of homo rec
	7. Equation for genotypic frequencies: p^2 + 2pq + q^2
2. Cladograms
	1. Node = where a branch starts
		1. From a node, you get a branch
	2. Bilateria = bilateral symmetry
		1. If not within Bilateria, animal may have radial 
	3. A shared derived trait that everyone afterward has = synapomorphy 
		1. Ex: For all animals under Bilateria, bilateral symmetry is a synapomorphic trait
		2. Symmetry of any kind would by a synapomorphic trait for Bilateria group and radial group
	4. Dotted line = suspected relationship but not known for sure
	5. Flighted insects to flighted vertebrates
		1. Not monophyletic bc no common ancestor w/ flight
		2. Polyphyletic group
			1. Analogous trait through convergent evolution
	6. Plesiomorphic trait = shared ancestral trait for all animals
		1. All animals are eukaryotic 
		2. Doesn't help us define relationships or classify monophyletic group
	7. Monophyletic groups have clear synapomorphic traits that link animals together
		1. Shared derived traits
3. Need to know eons, eras, periods, and sometimes epochs (most recently)
	1. Don't need to remember exact dates
	2. Should know relative age and dates of significant events
	3. Ex: Most animal life on this planet appeared during the last --- millions of years
		1. 500 (Cambrian explosion and earlier) - Phanerozoic eon
	4. Ex: Which of the periods is considered the age of fishes?
		1. The Devonian Period
4. Endosymbiosis
	1. Theory posed about the origin of eukaryotic cells
		1. Eukaryotic cells combine together to become multicellular later
5. Animal traits
	1. Radial/Bilateral
	2. Triploblastic, Diploblastic, Monoblastic
	3. Reference terms
		1. Cranial or Anterior, Caudal or Posterior, Dorsal/Ventral, Proximal/Distal, Sagittal plane, Frontal (coronal) plane, Transversal plane
		2. Superior (above)/Inferior (below)

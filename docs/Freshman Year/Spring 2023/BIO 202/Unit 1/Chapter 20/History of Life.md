1. Important Terms
	1. Phylogenetics = the study of ancestor and descendent relationships
		1. Biogenetics helps us understand relationships
	2. Phylogeny = building the evolutionary history of relationships between organisms or a group of organisms 
	3. Phylogenic tree = a visual representation of phylogeny
		1. Like a visual hypothesis
		2. Rooted = hypothesis is that there is a common ancestor of all the organisms in the tree
		3. Unrooted = no connection to a shared common ancestor
		4. General terms
			1. Root = the start of the tree
			2. Branches = branch off of the main root
				1. A leaf is like a species
			3. Sister taxa = branch and come off at the same area
				1. Same branching point
			4. Basal taxa = Early and unbranched
				1. The baseline
			5. Polytomy = a branch w/ two or more taxa
	4. Trait descriptors
		1. Ancestral (not primitive)
			1. Very old or ancient traits
		2. Derived (not advanced)
			1. Ex: mammals derived from early tetrapods
		3. Shared
			1. Shared between multiple species
			2. Everything above the trait on a tree shares that trait
	5. Limitations of Phylogenetic trees
		1. Close proximity doesn't mean the animals look alike
			1. Ex: frog vs lizard vs rabbit
				1. Lizard and rabbit more closely related even though they look more different than a frog and a lizard
		2. Branches are not time scaled
			1. No indication of time passage
		3. Convergent traits across taxa
			1. Ex: flight in mammals vs dinosaurs
				1. No single ancestor of all flighted organisms 
				2. Analogous trait and convergent evolution
		4. Ancestral groups still thrive
			1. All animals adapted to their environment independent of how ancestral or derived they are across time
		5. *Order of traits is informative*
	6. Systematics
		1. Organizes life based on evolutionary relatedness
2. Taxonomy ("to arrange")
	1. Unique, Universal, and Stable
		1. Shouldn't change much
	2. Internationally recognized
	3. Uses binomial nomenclature
		1. Carl Linnaeus 
	4. Taxon/taxa all looks at group(s) of related organisms
		1. May be different systems
		2. Taxon = refers to one group
		3. Taxa = multiple groups of related organisms
	5. Hierarchical Classification System
		1. Did -> Domain (ex Eukarya) 
			1. Supergroup
		2. King -> Kingdom (ex Animalia)
			1. Clade
			2. Over 8,700,000 species within animalia kingdom
		3. Philip -> Phylum (ex Chordata)
			1. Superclass
		4. Cry -> Class (ex Mammalia)
			1. Subclass
		5. Out -> Order (ex Carnivora)
		6. For -> Family (ex Felidae)
		7. Good -> Genus (ex Felis)
		8. Spaghetti -> Species (catus)
			1. Species = one kind of organism that can only interbreed with others of its kind
		9. Ex: cat = *Felis catus*, fox = *Vulpes vulpes* (red fox)
		10. Inclusive to Exclusive
			1. DKPCOFGS
			2. Everything seated below related to that which is seated above
		11. The more diverse your group, the more in-between categories you need (such as superclass)
	6. Major Taxonomic Groups
		1. Domains
			1. Prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea)
			2. Eukaryotes (Eukarya)
		2. Kingdoms
			1. Protista (Unicellular)
			2. Plantae (Photosynthetic)
			3. Fungi (Decomposers)
			4. Animalia (Consumers)
		3. Supergroups
			1. DNA -> reclassification -> protists
			2. Between Domain and Kingdom
	7. Traits to Determine Similarities
		1. Homologous structures
			1. Anatomically similar structures that were inherited from a common ancestor
			2. Ex: Mammalian forelimbs
				1. Humorous
				2. Ulna and Radius
				3. Metacarpals and Phalanges
		2. Analogous structures
			1. Also called *homoplasy*
			2. Anatomically similar structures w/ no direct evolutionary connection
			3. Originated independently multiple times (convergence)
			4. Ex: wings for flight
				1. Within all animals and mammals
				2. The exact wing design is different
				3. Function is the same (flight)
3. Importance of Phylogeny
	1. Tree of Life
		1. Many branches/offshoots
		2. Complex arrangements
		3. Clearly links all life together
	2. Why study phylogeny?
		1. Trait evolution
		2. Coevolution = symbiotic relationships develop
			1. Ex: Butterflies and plants
		3. Mode and pattern of speciation
			1. Allopatric vs sympatric 
		4. Biogeography = study of biological parts and geography and how that influences life
		5. Geographic origins
		6. Age of different taxa
		7. Nature of molecular evolution
		8. Disease epidemiology
4. Phylogenic Relationships
	1. Cladistics
		1. Classifying organisms by looking at homologous traits
	2. Clade
		1. A group of organisms at different hierarchical levels w/ shared evolutionary relationship
		2. Must be monophyletic
			1. Monophyletic group includes an ancestor and all of its descendants
			2. Monophyletic is best for our understanding
	3. Paraphyletic = includes ancestor and some, but not all of its descendants
	4. Polyphyletic group = Includes two convergent descendants but not their common ancestor
		1. Ex: flight through convergent evolution
	5. Paraphyletic
		1. Reptiles and birds
		2. Past data
			1. Put reptiles separate from birds
		3. Current data
			1. Birds and reptiles are more related than we originally thought
			2. Saurospida 
				1. Based on skull morphology that birds and reptiles share
	6. Polyphyletic
		1. Endothermy
			1. Convergence on endothermy by birds and mammals
		2. Common ancestor
			1. Ectothermic
	7. Pleiomorphies
		1. Shared ancestral trait
		2. Could be ancestral or derived depending on point of reference
		3. Ex: all mammals have hair
			1. Does presence of hair make a primate different from other mammals? no, its a  pleiomorphic trait
	8. Synapomorphies
		1. Shared derived traits
		2. Originates in last C.A.
		3. Indicate monophyletic group
		4. Hair is a synapomorphy trait compared to reptiles but pleiomorphic within mammals 
		5. Ex: placental mammals 
	9. Synapormorphic trait vs pleiomorphic trait depends on point of reference
		1. Ex: vertebrate is a pleiomorphic trait within mammals and reptiles but synapormorphic trait compared to our closest invertebrate animal 
	10. Parsimony
		1. Simplest explanations are preferred
			1. The fewest variables to explain a phenomena
			2. Used in mathematical models 
		2. When relating persimony to phylogenetics, trees w/ fewer steps are best
			1. Tree w/ fewest steps to describe relationship
			2. Ex: camera eye
				1. Octopus vs Vertebrates
					1. Every other invertebrate have different eyes
					3. If homologous, 5 instances of trait loss
					4. If convergent, 2 instances of trait gain 
						1. Convergent is parsimonious bc fewest variables
			3. Ex: whale evolution
				1. Whale ancestor that had legs then lost them is simplest explanation

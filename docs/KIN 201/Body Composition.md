1. Body composition = what your body is made of, most frequently considered as the ratio of fat-free mass to fat mass
	- Body fat percentage
2. Setting body comp goal is much healthier (and more appropriate) than a body weight goal
3. BMI vs body fat percentage
	- Pros: simple to measure, good for pop-based estimates
	- Cons: no difference given between fat and muscle
	- Below 18.5 - underweight
	- 18.5-24.9 - normal/healthy
	- 25.0-29.9 - overweight
	- 30 or higher - obese
	- Different thresholds indicate different risks
		1. Risk of heart disease and diabetes dramatically increases when BMI reaches these levels in large epidemiology studies
	- Can be very healthy but be in unhealthy category bc just ratio of height to weight
	- Body fat percentage gives appropriate credit for increases in fat free mass and decreases in fat mass, even if body weight is unchanged (or even increases)
4. What is body composition?
	- Essential body fat between males and females is different
	- The distribution of body fat is also an important indicator of health risks
		1. Fat around waist is more highly correlated w/ negative health outcomes than fat around the hips
5. Managing body composition is both product of genetics and lifestyle choices
	- Nutrition
	- Physical activity
	- In practice, find balance between Caloric intake and Caloric use
		1. Caloric use
			- Basal metabolic rate
			- Thermic effect of food
			- Physical activity
		2. [[Aerobic activity]]
			- 30 min of moderate-intensity activity likely uses about 250 calories
				1. 1250 calories from week's worth of moderate activity for avg person
		1. [[Resistance training]]
			- Doesn't use that many calories during exercise, but has potential to increase caloric use through altered basal metabolic rate
			- Also has potential to greatly increase fat free mass 
	- Changing body composition takes a dedicated approach over a prolonged period of time
		1. Recommended rate of weight loss - 0.5 to 2.0 lbs per week

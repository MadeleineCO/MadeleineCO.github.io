1. Under [[Clade Gnathostome]], [[Clade Osteichthyes]], and [[Clade Tetrapod]]
2. Extraembryonic membranes
	1. Chorian, Allantois, Amnion, Yolk sac
		1. AKA the amniotic egg
	2. Protects the embryo
	3. No more reliance on water
3. Thick waterproof skin
4. Ribs and lung ventilation
	1. Negative pressure breathing (or thoracic breathing)
5. Amniote divergence
	1. Temporal fenestrae
		1. "windows"
		2. Post-orbital skull opening
		3. Holes behind the eyes
		4. Have none, one, or two
			1. Synapsid = 1 fenestrae
				1. Mammal evolution route
			2. Anapsid = 0 fenestrae
				1. Ex: turtles (most other spp now extinct)
			3. Diapsid = 2 fenestrae
				1. Ex: reptiles evolution route
				2. Crocodilians, Ichthyosaurs, Pterosaurs, Dinosaurs, Birds
		5. Presence of fenestrae helps muscle attachment and lightens head 
6. Class Reptilia 
	1. Scaled amniotes
	2. Key characteristics
		1. Amniotic egg
			1. Leathery egg
		2. Thoracic breathing using negative pressure
			1. Increasing volume decreases pressure
			2. Creates pressure difference by expanding and contracting lungs
			3. More efficient breathing
		3. Dry, keratinized skin 
	3. Ectothermic
		1. Behavioral regulation
			1. Move in accordance w/ what they need
			2. Bask in sun or find shade
		2. Cold shock
	4. Most have 3-chambered heart
		1. Incomplete septum
			1. Allows reptiles to shunt blood to wherever they need (4-chambered doesn't allow this)
		2. Most reptile groups
		3. Blood can still mix so less efficient
	5. Crocodilians and Birds have 4-chambered heart
		1. Complete separation
		2. Blood never mixes so much more efficient
			1. Can control pressure better
		3. Allows birds (and mammals) to be endothermic vs ectothermic reptiles
	6. Major groups
		1. Tuataras
			1. First group to diversify
		2. Testudines
			1. Turtles (aquatic and terrestrial)
		3. Squamates
			1. Lizards and Snakes
			2. First reptiles after tuataras to diversify
			3. Lizard -> Snake
				1. Lost legs 
				2. Remnants of pelvic girdle and legs
		4. Crocodilians
			1. Fewer alive today
			2. Semiaquatic reptiles
			3. Not endothermic bc they don't need to be endothermic
				1. Assault predators 
			4. Survived Crustaceous mass extinction
				1. Been around a long time
7. Class Aves
	1. The birds
		1. 2nd most diverse group of vertebrates (as far as # of spp)
	2. Shared characteristics
		1. Calcareous egg
		2. 4-chambered heart
		3. Double circulation
		4. Endothermic
			1. Have higher body temp and metabolism than most mammals
			2. ---
	3. Characteristics of flight 
		1. Feathers
			1. Different types
				1. Down = fluffy for insulation (holds air)
		2. Hollow and fused bones
			1. Fused collar bone (wishbone)
			2. Hollow = lighter
			3. The heaviest birds do not fly
				1. Ex: ostrich, kiwi, penguins 
		3. Strong flight muscles in legs
			1. Allows them to get off the ground
		4. Air-sacs and lungs
			1. Air sacs don't participate in gas exchange
				1. Hold and direct air while flying
			2. Favioli 
			3. Pair of bronchus 
			4. Very efficient system for O2 use
	4. Ecology and Repro
		1. Internal fertilization and external development
			1. True for most reptiles as well (except for some snakes)
			2. All birds lay eggs
		2. Sexual dimorphism
			1. Very stark in many spp
			2. Ex: mallards, cardinals, etc.
			3. Males generally more colorful and oriental
			4. Many mating displays
		3. Some groups have lost the ability to fly
			1. Ex: Ostrich, kiwi, penguins, peafowl, dodo bird (extinct)
				1. Dodo birds killed off by dogs
	5. Pterabirds 
		1. Not dinosaurs
		2. Filed niche after dinosaurs died off
			1. Competed w/ smaller mammals
		3. Very large
			1. Taller than a man
		4. Huge beaks
8. Class Mammalia
	1. The mammals
	2. Shared characteristics
		1. Hair (keratin)
			1. Can be modified into a variety of structures
				1. Forms spines of porcupine, whiskers, etc.
			2. Hair follicle
			3. Glands nearby
			4. Fur is good for camouflage
		2. Mammary glands
			1. First form of parents suppling nutrition to young
				1. Egg creatures get nutrition from yolk
			2. High in sugars and lipids
			3. Helps establish immune system in young
			4. Suckling stimulates prolactin, causing more milk to be produced
				1. Positive feedback loop
			5. Fewer young, much more parental care
		3. 4-chambered heart
		4. Double circulation
		5. Endothermic
			2. Maintain steady temp within a range
				1. Hypo or hyperthermic outside of range
			3. Metabolic rate
				1. We can capture metabolic heat and use for body temp regulation
	3. Ecology and Repro
		1. Specialized teeth
			1. Same four types
			2. In different numbers and locations
			3. Omnivore vs Carnivore vs Herbivore
		2. Internal fertilization and development
			1. For most spp
	4. Placenta
		1. Amnion layers
			1. All four egg layers present
		3. Mother -> baby
			1. Mother provides everything the baby needs
		4. Blood flow 
		5. Oxygen, nutrient, and waste exchange
		6. Acts as shock absorber as well
	5. Groups
		1. Monotremes
			1. Egg layers!
				1. Poorly developed nipples
				2. Milk -> fur
					1. Young lick milk off the fur
			2. Echidna and platypus
				1. Platypus have venomous spurs 
					1. Very painful
		2. Marsupials
			1. Pouched mammals
			2. Short internal development
				1. Born and migrate to pouch
			3. Pouch w/ nipples
				2. Pouch development
					1. Finish development inside the pouch
			4. ---
		3. Placental Mammals
			1. Well developed mammary glands w/ high fat content
			2. Humans and cows = about 3-5% fat
			3. Seals = 25% fat
				1. Grow up very quickly
			4. Weaning
				1. Varies greatly 
			5. Gestation periods
				1. Mouse = 20 days
					1. Can produce litter every month
				2. Humans = 9 months
				3. Elephants = 22 months
					1. Longest by far
				4. Blue Whales = 14 months
			6. Orcas
				1. Scary mammals!
				2. Feed on salmon, otters, seals, dolphins, sting rays, and more

1. Trait of Importance
	1. *Milk Production*
	2. Looking at feet, udder, stature, etc. all geared towards milk production
	3. Contrast to beef, which involves many different goals
	4. Holstein is the leading breed when it comes to milk yield
		1. Also have Jersey, ---
	5. |Trait | Degree of Important | h^2|
	    |----- | ------------------------ | -----|
	    |*MP* | high | mod|
	    |*Fertility* | high | low|
	    |*% fat* | mod | mod/high|
	    |*Type* | mod | mod|
	    |*Temperament* | mod | mod|
	    |*Calving ease* | mod | low|
		1. Higher volume = increased fat
			1. Fat is measured by volume
			2. Liter of Holstein milk vs Liter of Jersey 
				1. Jersey tends to produce higher concentrations of fat
		2. Temperament is an important trait to select for so they don't hurt you
		3. Must know these traits
			1. These are the traits we select for 
		4. Type Traits 
			1. Many, many linear traits 
				1. May need to list 3 or 4, but don't need to memorize all 
				2. Moderate h^2
			2. Stature
			3. Strength
			4. Body Depth
			5. Dairy Form
			6. Rump Angle
			7. Rump Weight
			8. Rear Legs - Side View
			9. Rear Legs - Rear View
			10. Foot Angle
			11. Feet and Leg Scores 
			12. Fore Udder Attachment
			13. Rear Udder Height
			14. Rear Udder Weight
			15. Udder Cleft
			16. Front Teat Placement
			17. Udder Composite
			18. Feet and Leg Composite
	6. Milk Production and the Traits
		1. H^2 = 0.35
		2. Genetic Correlation w/ Milk Production
			1. Fat yield = +0.75
			2. % fat = -0.40
			3. Type = weak, positive
			4. Reproduction?
				1. Probably negative
				2. Fertility and Production in opposition

2. [[Mating Systems]] in Dairy
	1. Crossbreeding
		1. Hardly used
		2. If it is used, used from standpoint of trying to improve reproduction
			1. Repro is low h^2 so you get higher heterosis
		3. Milk Production is first objective
			1. In lbs of milk, Holstein is superior
			2. In % milk fat, Jersey is superior 
		4. Comparison of Pure Holstein to First Generation Crosses 
			1. See chart on slideshow
			2. Star = statistically significant
			3. Holsteins produce more milk than crossbreds 
				1. Also produce more fat than Normande X HO and Mont x HO
			4. Crosses decrease calving difficulty
				1. Improvement
				2. Relates to combining ability
					1. Some breeds combine better than others
				3. Fewer stillbirths in crossbreeds
				4. Days open is similar between crossbreds and Holsteins 
					1. Slightly lower
				5. Cull fewer crossbreds than pure Holsteins 
			5. Mostly Reproductive Benefits to Crossbreeding
				1. Not MP improvements
	2. Sources of genetic improvement in dairy
		1. Sire is the major source of genetic improvement
			1. Most genetic progress by selecting is based on sire bc they can produce the more offspring than the dam
				1. Either sires of sires or sires of dams
		2. Can also select by dams of sires or dams of dams
			1. Very little genetic progress by selecting based on dams
		3. Why is [[Selection]] based primarily on sires?
			1. Greater num of progeny vs dams
			2. AI allows for even larger number of progeny (45% of operations have no bulls)
			3. ---
		4. Select sires based on PTA's (Predicted Transmitting Ability)
			1. Ex: Select Sires Red Holstein Lineup
				1. See chart on slideshow
				2. Comparing individual to the avg of the population
3. National Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA)
	1. Maintains a system of records
		1. Use Modified Contemporary Comparison
			1. Standardization of all records of performance to account for as many sources of variation as possible
	2. Can compare animals from different breeds, herds, locations, etc.
	3. DHIA is a private cooperate operation that works through NCSU
		1. Greater than 45% of US producers participate
4. Factors Leading to the Ultimate Success of the Dairy Industry
	1. Utilization of *record system* based on comparisons of contemporaries on a similar basis
	2. Limited num of traits selected
	3. Adoption of tech
		1. Genomic [[Selection]]
			1. Allows people to estimate BVs
				1. EBV = h^2(x - mx) / 2
			2. GEBV = Genomic Estimating Breeding Value
				1. Based on DNA
			3. Genomics = The large-scale use of DNA info to estimate the genetic merit of cattle
				1. Includes knowledge of differences in DNA sequences of individual cattle 
					1. Can associated those differences w/ actual performance
					2. Those locations become markers that indicate performance differences between the individual and other cattle
			4. Summarizes a genetic map of what traits animal inherited from each of its parents
				1. Includes the combination of their PA and genotypic data, providing more reliable results
			5. Example of genomic PTAs and bulls ![[Pasted image 20230322102713.png]]
				1. Full sibs are expected to perform very similarly, but genomics can determine if one will perform better than the other
					1. Like using a magnifying glass 
				2. Rank from best to worst = C, A, B
		2. AI
			1. Many operations do not have bulls
			2. Rely on female synchronization
		3. Env control to optimize env to maximize production
			1. Striving for top-notch. . .
				1. Health programs
				2. Nutrition
				3. Facilities
				4. Equipment
			2. Modifying the env to fit the animal 
				1. Beef is the opposite (fitting animal to env)
		4. bST 
			1. Bovine Somatotrophin 
			2. Growth hormone that naturally occurs in cows and humans 
			3. Major regulator of milk production
				1. Administration of exogenous bST (Posilac) can increase milk production 
			4. Relationship w/ IGF-1 (another growth hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)
				1. Adequate nutrition = Increased IGF-1 = Increased milk production
				2. Inadequate nutrition = No change in IGF-1 = No change in milk production
			5. No detectable difference in milk composition 
			6. Increased incidence of mastitis (if you adjust for the increase in MP, the incidence of mastitis is not increased)
				1. Highly productive animals even without used of bST have higher rates of mastitis

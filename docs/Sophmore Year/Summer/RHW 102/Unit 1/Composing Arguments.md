1. How Does Rhetoric Shape Our Reality? 
	1. In ancient Greece, all communicative acts were classified into *five categories*
		1. Aristotle called these the Canons of Rhetoric
		2. Invention: creating and constructing ideas and identifying the best modes of persuasion
		3. Arrangement: ordering and laying out ideas through effective organization
		4. Style: developing the appropriate expression for those ideas
		5. Memory: retaining invented ideas, recalling additional supporting ideas, and facilitating memory in the audience
		6. Delivery: presenting or performing ideas w/ the aim of persuading
			1. Oral in ancient Greece
		7. This chapter focus on three canons - invention, arrangement, and style
2. Invention
	1. Aristotle defined invention as methods for "finding all available arguments"
	2. When you craft language to persuade audience, you are inventing an argument
		1. Generating ideas about a topic and ways to best persuade audience
	3. Two systems for invention
		1. Statis: a series of questions that speakers could use to identify a point or topic for debate
		2. Topoi: a set of categories or topics that help speaker discern relationships between ideas
		3. You can draw from central premise of categories and directed questioning to help you familiarize yourself w/ your topic and the options for argument
	4. Fact: What are you talking about? Is it person, text, idea, event? Real world or speculative?
	5. Definition: What does it mean? What are other examples?
	6. Division: What are its parts? What are its different features?
	7. Comparison: How does it compare to other topics or texts? Does it mean something new now versus years ago?
	8. Purpose: What is its purpose? Inform? Teach? Entertain? Persuade? Promote action? How does that purpose influence its structure?
	9. Quality: Is it possible to evaluate what you're talking about? Where does it fall into categories of right/wrong, moral/immoral, etc?
	10. Causes and Consequences: What causes the issue or text? What are results?
	11. Testimony: What do others say about it?
	12. Some of these lines of questioning may be more applicable than others, but help to generate foundation for persuasive argument
		1. Can use range of rhetorical strategies to further invent your argument
			1. Ethos, logos, pathos, kairos, doxa
	13. Can look for examples in texts around you
		1. Can learn about how author chooses most effective modes of persuasion
		2. Consider pictures
			1. Texts of rhetorical invention
			2. A version of reality created by a photographer's rhetorical and artistic decisions
				1. Filters, positioning, lighting, backdrops, etc.
			3. Same elements (selection, placement, perspective, and framing) are critical to making an argument
		3. All texts are shaped by the individual perspective and point of view
			1. POV and rhetorical situation
		4. Consider what will be the subject of your text
			1. Individual? Group? Institution?
			2. Zoomed in or out? 
		5. Choices determine impact of argument
3. Arrangement in Argument
	1. Argument = second canon of rhetoric after invention
		1. Shapes reader's response to your ideas
	2. Can be layout or order you structure your argument
		1. Arrangement of argument separates a spontaneous reaction or stream-of-consciousness free write from a carefully developed and argued essay on a specific issue or topic
	3. Ex: photo essay of horrors of Japanese camps during WWII
		1. www.cnn.com/2017/02/18/us/gallery/ansel-adams-manzanar-camp/index.html
		2. Strategic arrangement of photos amplifies concepts 
		3. Creates emotional connection w/ reader by focusing on individual example
			1. Close-ups of children, a nurse, and veterans
			2. Suggests unfairness of the relocation process
			3. Portrayal of a common family scene
			4. Point = injustices of the internment process
		4. Deliberate rhetorical choices in moving from capturing individual images to arranging them into powerful sequences and arguments on the page
	4. The way you organize your essay should be dictated by the conventions of the discipline or genre
		1. Ex: history paper has different structure from lab report or public policy paper
		2. You might decide to draw on one of these common structures to organize ideas into a convincing and well-organized written argument
	5. Structures of Arguments
		1. Chronological Structure: Demonstrates change over time
			1. Relies on examples arranged in a temporal sequence so it can be an effective structure
		2. Process or Narrative: Arranges info sequentially, moving from beginning to end
		3. Cause-effect: Shows how one event causes another
		4. Problem-solution: Defines the problem and then offers a solution
		5. Block Structure: Works systematically through a series of examples or case studies
		6. Thematic or Topical Structure: Organizes by themes or subtopics
		7. Inductive Reasoning: Begins w/ guiding question and defers thesis to your conclusion
	6. Aristotle proposed that arguments should be composed of statement of case and proof/support for that case
		1. However, other rhetoricians, including Cicero and Quintilian espoused a more complex approach
			1. Six-part structure
				1. Introduction (or exordium): Orator states topic and develops ethos as well as connection w/ audience
				2. Statement of facts or background (or narratio): Provides audience w/ context and key info
				3. Division (or partitio): Summarizes different lines of argument (provides overview/road map of parts to follow)
					1. Like thesis
				4. Proof (or confirmatio): Contains heart of argument where orator presents central claims, supported by evidence/facts/reasons
					1. Like main body
				5. Refutation (or refutatio): Orator anticipates any objections and evaluates those counterarguments
				6. Conclusion (or peroratio): Summarizes strongest points of claim and makes final appeal to audience
				7. Each part can be comprised of single paragraph or several paragraphs
				8. Moves from firm grounding to consideration of counterarguments before reemphasizing the orator's position at the end
					1. To often, we are tempted to focus only on our own position without addressing counterarguments
					2. We build credibility by demonstrating that we have thought through alternate arguments 
4. Style in Argument
	1. Must consider tone, word choice, and voice
	2. Style concerns choosing appropriate expression for ideas of your argument
	3. Tone = the general character or attitude of a piece of writing
	4. Syntax = the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language
	5. Also involves rhetorical appeals
	6. Metaphors = a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable
	7. Imagery = visually descriptive or figurative language, especially in a literary work
	8. Consider placement of quotations, level of emphasis, and nuance as well
	9. Nuance = a subtle difference in or shade of meaning, expression, or sound
	10. Should address a specific audience and can thus build your ethos w/ those readers
	11. Constructing your Persona
		1. Persona has roots in Latin word for "mask"
			1. A deliberately crafted version of yourself that you construct in response to a specific audience or context
		2. Tailored for specific rhetorical situations
		3. Think about the ethos you want to cultivate 
		4. Functions as a rhetorical construction of self
		5. Number of stylistic choices such as tone, word choice and dictation, imagery, sentence structure, use of rhetorical appeals, and strategies of persuasion
		6. Can facilitate a strong connection w/ readers and therefore make argument more persuasive
		7. Must retain sense of authenticity in your voice despite speaking through rhetorical mask
			1. Not new character, just alternate of self
	12. Choosing a Rhetorical Stance
		1. Must not only create a persona that responds to your rhetorical situation and engages both audience and text, but also must convey a position that Wayne Booth defined as the *rhetorical stance*
			1. Refers to position that author assumes in relation to subject, audience, and context
			2. Careful and deliberate navigation of the rhetorical situation and appeals w/ intent to persuade audience
			3. Not just a stand that you take in relation to an issue, but also a more dynamic position we assume to accommodate to our understanding of the rhetorical situation
		2. Booth argued that communication failed between people (or a text failed to persuade a reader) if writer takes stance that ignores balance of rhetorical situation
		3. If rhetorical situation, the relationship between author, audience, and text, is out of balance, the argument itself is less persuasive
	13. Titles
		1. Constructing a powerful title may start or end the process
		2. Developing a strong title can help clarify central claim and rhetorical stance and set up clear expectations for audience
		3. A strong title should accomplish two goals
			1. Clearly identify the essay's topic and (occasionally) the claim
			2. Capture the reader's attention
		4. Strategies
			1. Link title to main point or claim
			2. Pose a question raised by your argument
			3. Play w/ language
				1. Ex: alliteration
			4. Connect to a key image, underlying metaphor, or guiding concept
			5. Use a quote from one of your sources
		5. Depends on audience and rhetorical situation
		6. In academic essays and research papers, we often see two-part titles
			1. Pairs a catchy initial title with a more descriptive subtitle after a colon
		7. Styles differ
			1. Title for lab report for Bio class will differ from style for title of paper for biomedical ethics class
			2. Matter of rhetoric
	14. Composing Your Introduction
		1. Might be single paragraph, two part intro, etc.
		2. Establishes voice, tone, persona, and stance on topic
		3. Careful attention to word choice, sentence structure, and strategies of development
		4. Often start broad then focus on thesis
			1. Background info
		5. Capture attention of reader through "hook"
			1. To hook readers, use one or combination of following techniques
				1. Define your terms
					1. Especially if you're writing on a subject that may not be familiar w/ audience
				2. Significant quotation, provoking question, or startling statistic
				3. Present an overview of issues
				4. Provide some background on topic
				5. Use an anecdote or narration
				6. Incorporate a vivid example
				7. Draw on relevant analogy or metaphor
				8. Use second-person pronoun (you) to connect w/ readers
				9. Use first-person pronoun (I/we) to demonstrate your personal investment in the topic
					1. You can always use "I" in this class
	15. Writing Your Conclusion
		1. Offers opportunity to hook audience while providing rhetorical stance
			1. Final opportunity to reinforce argument while making lasting impact
			2. May synthesize key points
				1. Key is not to introduce a new point but instead use the "sinker" to draw together
		2. Must signal reader you are moving to end of argument
			1. Avoid relying on phrase like "in conclusion" and consider more elegant gestures
		3. Must reiterate main point of argument
		4. Strategies to move final section beyond simple summary
			1. Use a key quotation, example, or reference taht either epitomizes or synthesizes yoru points
			2. Return to an example, anecdote, allusion, or analogy from introduction, offering a slightly different or perhaps more informed perspective to connect to opening paragraphs and provide sense of frame
			3. Use a chronological structure to move from past to recent times, perhaps ending w/ projection into future
			4. Use conclusion to suggest broader implications that could increase reader's sense of the importance
				1. Consider call to action
5. Summary
	1. When we bring different angles, versions of events, and personas, then an issue that seems polarized is actually more complex
		1. Must engage multiple perspectives to be persuasive
	2. Invention, arrangement, and style help us compose effective arguments
		1. Remember importance of persona and rhetorical stance
	3. Try to think of arguments not in terms of right or wrong or pro or can but rather as a spectrum of differing perspectives

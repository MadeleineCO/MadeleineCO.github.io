1. Central Nervous System
	1. Processes and decides what to do from PNS info
	2. Then tells what PNS to do
	3. Receives info and sends back instructions 
2. Vertebrate Brains
	1. Hindbrain
		1. Cerebellum
		2. Pons
		3. Medulla oblongata
	2. Midbrain
		1. Optic tectum
			1. Where retinas integrate
			2. Involves vision
	3. Forebrain
		1. Thalamus and hypothalamus
		2. Basal ganglia
		3. Corpus callosum
			1. Connects left and right hemispheres 
		4. Hippocampus (limbic system)
		5. Cerebral cortex
	4. Vertebrate Brain Evolution
		1. See graphic for brain transitions
			1. Fish brain is stretched out
			2. Same parts
				1. A lot of brain is dedicated to senses that are most important for the particular organism
			3. Enlargement of brain over time in vertebrates 
				1. Moving up and over as well
			4. Even tunicates and lancelets have similar base structure
		2. Enlargement of the cerebrum over time
			1. Size of brain is not the only way to estimate intelligence
				1. Imperfect assessment
3. Cerebrum
	1. Cerebral cortex
		1. Few mm thick (10%)
		2. *Gyrus* (convulsions)
			1. Worm-like tissue
		3. *Sulcus* (creases)
			1. Creases of the cerebrum
	2. Functions
		1. Higher thinking
		2. Personality
		3. Skeletal muscle
		4. Sensory info
	3. Cerebral hemispheres
		1. Connected by the corpus callosum
		2. Left and right
	4. Four lobes
		1. Frontal (front)
			1. Olfaction
		2. Parietal (top)
			1. Speech/reading
			2. Touch/orientation
		3. Occipital (back)
			1. Audition
		4. Temporal (sides)
			1. Audition
	5. Thalamus and Hypothalamus
		1. Relays sensory information to the occipital, temporal, or parietal lobes
		3. Hypothalamus
			1. Hypo = "below"
				1. Sits below the thalamus
			2. Regulates body temp
			3. Hunger/satiety
			4. Thirst
			5. Hippocampus and amygdala part of the limbic system
				1. Ancestral
				2. Emotional part of brain
				3. Linked w/ instinct
	6. Other structures of note
		1. Medulla oblongata
			1. Controls breathing
			2. Regulates heart rate
		2. Cerebellum
			1. Posture and balance
			2. Linked w/ otoliths (ear stones)
				1. Small crystals located in the inner ear
				2. Part of vestibular system
		3. Pons
			1. Transmits brain info to spinal cord
			2. Sometimes spinal cord doesn't need brain at all 
				1. Ex: kneejerk reflex, blinking
	7. Spinal Cord
		1. Conveys and controls messages
			1. Reflex reactions (kneejerk, blinking)
		2. Meninges
			1. Inflammation of tissue covering CNS
			2. Spinal cord is separate from immune system so cannot protect itself easily if infected
		3. White matter
			1. Sensory and motor axons
		4. Gray matter
			1. Inter- and motor neurons + neuroglai
		5. Dorsal horn
			1. Sensory axons
		6. Ventral horn
			1. ---
4. Encephalization Quotient (EQ)
	1. A measure of intelligence
		2. Ratio of mass of brain to mass of body
		3. Red line indicates average intelligence 
		4. See graphic

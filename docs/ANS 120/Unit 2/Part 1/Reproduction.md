1. Importance
	1. Just a 3% improvement in reproductive rate would greatly increase num of animals and consequently production
	2. Increase in productivity and efficiency lowers cost
	3. Alter reproduction
		- Sometimes want to increase reproduction (ex endangered species)
		- Sometimes want to limit reproduction (feral cats)
		- Much easier to mess up reproduction than improve it
2. Terms
	1. Estrous Cycle = All physiological and behavioral changes from one ovulation to the next consecutive ovulation ([[Reproduction]])
		- Menstrual Cycle in humans and primates is very different
	2. Estrus = Period of receptivity to be bred by the male
	3. Ovum = Female gamete
	4. Follicle = Involves the ovum and all the cells that support ovum development in an ovary
	5. Ovulation = Release of the ovum from the follicle
		- The follicle ruptures and the ovum is released away from the ovary
	6. Gestation = The process of prenatal development of an organism in the uterus
		- Chicken egg development does not occur in uterus, so never a fetus, always an embryo (incubation, not gestation)
	7. Parturition = The birth process
	8. Oviposition = The process of laying an egg (usually [[avian|avians]])
	9. Incubation = Embryonic development outside the body (usually [[avian|avians]])
	10. See chart for [[Animal-Specific Reproductive Info.png]]!
	11. Duplex = Two cervixes (Marsupials and rodents)
	12. Bicornate = Poorly to moderately developed uterine horns in mares and cows but highly developed in bitches, queens, and sows
		- Livestock, cats, dogs
		- Two ovaries, two oviducts, a single cervix, uterine horns, uterine body, vagina 
			- [[Reproductive Structures]]
			- Estrous cycle
				1. If a cow's cycle is 210 days, First the follicle grows and produces estrogen until it peaks and ovulation occurs (which breaks the follicle). Then, the corpus luteum grows and produces P4. If animal not pregnant, the corpus luteum and P4 goes away, follicle starts regrowing, and cycle restarts.
					1. Cows have multiple follicles, but only one ends up ovulation. "Follicle wars"
	13. Simplex = no cervix
		- Humans, primates
	14. [[Avian]] Reproduction ([[Reproductive Structures]])
		- 1 left ovary
			1. Contains yolk with ovum 
				- Yolk has energy, minerals, vitamins, and some protein
				- Color of yolk depends on diet
		- 1 modified left oviduct
			1. Infundibulum = funnel
				- Captures ovum and if breeding has occurred, fertilization occurs there
			2. Magnum = Albumen is added 
				- Albumen is the primary protein
				- Some structural proteins
			3. Isthmus = Inner and outer shell membrane
		- Uterus/Shell gland = Shell formation
			1. Shell is made up of calcium carbonate (highly polar salts)
			2. Some shells have pigments from pigment producing cells
		- Cloaca = common opening
		- Egg
			1. Shell, shell membrane (inner and outer), Chalaza attached to yolk, ---
			2. Incubation NOT gestation
			3. Chicks don't need to eat or drink for about three days because yolk ruminants  
3. [[Estrus Cycle and Parturition Process]]
	1. Sperm and ovum are both haploid 
		- Have half of chromosomes
		- Embryo is diploid and contains both sets of chromosomes
		- Ovum has zona pelluie (shell)
			- Sperm combines w/ ovum and creates embryo
	2. Embryo
		- Starts dividing 
			- Cells get smaller as they divide 
		- Cells begin to specialize
		- The zona pelluiea still on outside surrounding inner cell mass
		- Tripoplast Cells within shell that become placenta
			- Eventually break out as placenta
	3. Placenta = Fetal origin (out pocketing of the small intestine)
		1. Has several layers
			- Amnion (inner)
			- Chorion (middle)
			- Allantois (outer)
				- Watery fluid in the outside layer
				- Ruptures first (water breaking)
		2. Chorioallantois = fused layers of placenta (Chorion + Allantois) making up the outer sac
		3. Amnionic sac = makes up the inner sac
		5. Placenta attached to internal organism by ambilocal cord
		6. Uterine wall surrounds it all
		7. Functions
			- Exchange of products between the dam (mother) and offspring
				1. Nutrients an waste
				3. Oxygen and carbon dioxide
			- Hydraulic dampener
				1. Shock absorption 
				2. Ex: if mother is running, protects fetus from banging around
			- Parturition 
				1. Cervical dilation
					- Chorioallantois
					- 1st water sac expands (then ruptures/water breaking)
				2. Lubrication
					- Amnion fluid = lubricant in the birth canal
		8. Embryo
			- Called a fetus after the placental attaches to the uterine wall
			- A bird or reptile is always an embryo
			- In cattle, placental attachment takes time (from about 20-40 days)
		9. Types of attachment
			- Diffuse = attachment occurs via microvilli throughout the uterus
				1. Horse and pig
			- Zonary = regional diffuse attachment
				1. The attachment is diffuse, but only in a band or strip of the placenta to the uterus
				2. Dog and cat
			- Cotyledonary = attachment of placenta occurs only at specific sites located on the uterus wall
				1. Cattle, sheep, goats
			- Discoid = placenta attaches to the uterine wall by a single disc-shaped component
				1. Primates
			- Need enough layers that nutrients, waste, co2, and o2 go back and forth, but NOT blood components
				1. Prevents immune responses from attaching fetus
4. Parturition 
	- See duration of stages table!
	- Animals usually hide
		1. Avoiding predators 
	- Stage I = Final preptory 
		1. Uterine contractions 
		2. Cervical dilation
		3. Repositioning of fetus
			- Doesn't matter in small litter-baring species
			- Laying down and getting up helps to reposition
			- Feet should be turned down (?) to be head first
	- Stage 2 = Delivery of fetus
		1. Must start when the 1st sac breaks
	- Stage 3 = Removal of placenta
		1. In diffuse attachment, placenta comes out quickly
		2. Cotyledonary attachment takes longer
			- Fewer attachments, but stronger
	- Afterward, cows lick to stimulate baby, then later baby walks, then it starts nursing all over the course of several hours
	- Dystocia = some difficulty with the parturition process
		1. Pretty rare
		1. Possible causes
			- Birth weight to dam size issues
				1. Calf too big/dam too small
				2. If calf too big, you should pull down toward hox, not straight out
					- Grab bone, not joints
				3. The bigger the species, the more likely an issue may occur
					- More common in calves than sheep
			- Problems w/ conditions of the dam
				1. Extremes are problematic
					- Not sufficient nutrients or excess nutrients
						1. Not enough energy for parturition or excess fat in pelvic rim decreases diameter
				1. Too limited in condition
			- Malpresentation
				1. Least common 
					- <1% of dystocia in cattle
				2. Coming out the wrong way (ex legs first)
				3. Pigs don't need a specific orientation (very small compared to dam)

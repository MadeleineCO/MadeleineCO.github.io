HWE Definition::In a large, randomly mating population, gene/allelic and genotypic frequencies will remain *constant* from generation to generation in the absence of mutation, migration, genetic drift, selection, and recombination.
^1675524043885

HWE Frequency Equations::Allelic: p + q = 1; Genotypic: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
^1675524043895

The HWE is based on --- principles::Mendel's; By G. H. Hardy (1877-1947) and Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937); Hardy and Weinberg independently devised the same equation
^1675524043902

In HWE, the population will be in equilibrium if not disrupted by ---::evolutionary forces; Most populations do not completely follow HWE assumptions (No genetic drift, No mutation, No recombination, No selection, Large, sexually reproducing population);  These are all mechanisms acting within populations, an occurrence called "population genetics" - *except* for epigenetic modifications, which act on individuals in a Lamarckian manner
^1675524043910

Requirements of HW::Large pop size, Random mating, No mutations, No migration, No natural selection
^1675524043917

Violation of HWE (Evolution)::Genetic Drift, Inbreeding and nonrandom mating, Mutations, Migration, Natural Selection
^1675524043925

Testing for HWE can be used to assess whether a population is ---::evolving; Are you making progress w/ your crosses?; A pop that is *not* evolving shows allele and genotypic frequencies that are in HWE; If a pop isn't in HWE, it can be concluded that the pop is evolving (Frequencies will not remain constant from generation to generation)
^1675524043932

Population::A group of individuals within a species that is capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring; Interbreed + fertile offspring
^1675524043940

According to the HW principle, frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a pop remain ---::constant from generation to generation; In a given pop where gametes contribute to the next generation randomly, allele frequencies will not change; Follows the transmission rules of Mendelian inheritance, which maintains constant proportions in a pop across generations
^1675524043947

If p and q represent the relative frequencies of the only two possible alleles in a pop at locus then ---::p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
^1675902014172

HW Equation -  One locus, three alleles::(p + q + r)^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr
^1675902014184

HW Equation - One locus, n # alleles::(p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ... + pn)^2 + 2p1p2 + 2p1p3 + 2p1p4 + ... 2pn-1pn
^1675902014191

HW Equation - For a polyploid (more than two chromosomes)::(p + q)^c where c = num of chromosomes
^1675902014196

If multiple loci (genes) code for a trait, each locus follows the HW principle ---::independently, and then the genes interact to influence the trait
^1675902014201

For diploid organisms, the total num of alleles at a locus is the total num of individuals multiplied by ---::two
^1675902014207

The total num of dom alleles at a locus is two alleles for ---::each homo dom individual 
^1675902014211

PKU is a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity of the ---::rec allele; Cannot break down phenylamine; PKU = 1 per 10,000 births so q^2 = 0.0001 and q = 0.01; P = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99; 2pq = 0.0198 or about 2% of the population
^1675902014217

Rare detrimental recessives often remain in a pop bc they are ---::hidden in the hetero state (the carriers); Natural selection can only act on the homo rec individuals where the phenotype is exposed 
^1675902014222

Deviation from HWE indicates that ---::evolution is happening; Ex: AA = 0.64, Aa = 0.32, aa = 0 (does not equal 1 so violation of HWE); Any form of change in frequency from generation to generation violates HWE 
^1675902014228

Simply Inherited Traits::Traits affected by one or few genes (qualitative or categorical traits)::Phenotypes of simply inherited traits are placed into categories; Env has little effect; Ex: coat color, presence of horns, genetic defects such as spider syndrome in sheep
^1675902014234

Polygenic Traits::Traits affected by many genes (quantitative); No single gene has an overriding effect; Ex: growth rate, milk production, birth weight; Generally described in numbers over a range of values (exception is dystocia which is affected by many genes but phenotype is described in categories); Affected by env
^1675902014239


Basic Model for Quantitative Traits::P = u + G + E; u = mew (pop mean or avg phenotypic value for the trait in the pop); P = phenotypic value; G = genotypic value; E = env effect
^1675902014244

Genotypic value is the overall effect of all ---::genes carried by the animal; Unlike the P value, G is not directly measurable
^1675902014250

The genotypic value is the sum of ---::breeding value (BV) and gene combination value (GCV); G = BV + GCV
^1675902014255

Breeding value::The part of the genotypic value that can be transmitted from parent to offspring; Sum of effects of individual genes (called independent gene effects or additive gene effects); Independent of the effects of dominance and epistasis; AKA additive gene value
^1675902014261

Before we select animals to be parents of the next generation, we first estimate their ---::breeding values and choose those w/ the best BVs
^1675902014266

In the equation P = u + G + E, G and E are expressed as --- from the mean of the pop::deviations; Therefore, the mean of the G in the pop and the mean of E should equal zero
^1675902014274

[[2023-02-11]]
Beef polygenic traits::Growth traits (birth weight, weaning weight, yearling weight, avg daily gains); Carcass yield (merit; IMF - intramuscular fat, thickness, rib-eye)
^1676147044340

Beef polygenic reproductive traits::Semen production/scrotum circumference (bigger also means offspring reach puberty younger); Heifer pregnancy (pregnant between 12 months and 15 so she can have first calf at 2 yrs), First service conception (pregnant on the first AI service is ideal), Rebreeding rate, Stayabilitiy (cow is able to produce a calf every year for three yrs) 
^1676147044359

Dairy polygenic traits::Milk yield (volume and persistence), Milk components (percent fat and protein), Reproductive traits (heifer pregnancy, first service conception, days open (less than 90 days))
^1676147044368

Breeding value is estimated from multiple --- values::gene; If heifer pregnancy is controlled by 3000 genes, then you have to calculate the total BV for each cow from the alleles
^1676147044376

An individual only transmits a sample composed of ---::half its genes to each of its offspring; Random half of its genes
^1676147044384

Progeny difference (PD) or transmitting ability (TA) are used in practice by many countries to ---::rank animals; EPD for meat animals (beef cattle, swine, sheep) while TA used in dairy cattle breeding
^1676147044394

Estimated progeny difference (EPD)::The predicted value for PD is called EPD; Meat animal breeding; If weaning weight in a EPD is listed as +2.0, then the offspring of the bull will likely weight 2 lbs more than the avg of the breed
^1676147044402

The predicted value for TA is called ---::PTA (predicted transmitted ability); used in dairy breeding
^1676147044410

Progeny difference and transmitting ability are practical concepts that are defined as the expected difference between the ---::mean performance of the progeny of a parent and the mean performance of the progeny of all parents in the population
^1676147044419

PD, TA, and BV::PD = TA = 1/2 BV; PDi = TAi = u (offspring of parent i) - u (offspring of all animals); PD and TA are not directly measurable but can be predicted using performance data
^1676147044426

The BV of an offspring can be viewed as the sum of the ---::additive effects of the genes inherited from the sire and the additive effects of the genes inherited from the dam; BV (offspring) = (BV (sire) + BV (dam)) / 2
^1676147044434

If estimated BV of a sire for weaning weight is +1.5 kg then the avg of the expected BV of their offspring is equal to ---:: (2.5 + 1.5)/2 = +2 kg; P = u + BV (offspring); If the pop mean of weaning wgt is 18 kg, then the avg phenotype of the offspring of these sire and dam is 18 + 2 = 20 kg
^1676147044445

GVC is part of the genotypic value that is due to ---::gene combination effects (dominance and epistasis); BV + G = GVC
^1676148705720

Because individual genes and not gene combinations survive segregation and independent assortment during meiosis, GVC can *not* be ---::transmitted from parent to offspring; Not important in selection
^1676148705736

Producing Ability (PA)::Represents the performance potential of an animal for a repeated trait (the ability of the animal to repeat its performance of all those factors that permanently potential of the animal); Function of all these factors
^1676148705743

For repeated traits (traits for which an animal has more than one performance record during its lifetime), the --- is very important::producing ability (PA); For traits that can be measured multiple times during the life of the animal; Ex: milk yield, egg yield, daily gain, wool production
^1676148705751

The GV and its components (GV and GCV) are determined at ---::conception and remain w/ the animal during its whole life; Some env factors may permanently affect the PA and performance of the animal (Ep)
^1676148705758

Env effects that do *not* affect performance permanently are called ---::temporary env effects (Et); As compared to Ep; Vary season to season, yr to yr, etc.; Do not influence different records in the same way; Ex: forage quality, weather conditions, management practices 
^1676148705766

The genetic model for repeated traits is ---::P + u + BV + GCV + Ep + Et; Expanded form of P = u + G + E
^1676148705772

The PA is a combination of --- effects::genetic and permanent env; PA = G + Ep -> PA = BV + GCV + Ep; The avg of PA is 0 across the pop bc it is expressed as a deviation from the mean
^1676148705782

PA is important to commercial producers as a measure of ---::producing capacity; Typically dairy farmers feed their cows according to their PA; Prediction of PA is quite useful in practice 
^1676148705792

The predicted value of PA is called ---::Most Probable Producing Ability (MPPA); P = u + MPPA is a prediction of the animal's next record
^1676148705800

[[2023-02-14]]
Why study statistics?::Objective is the evaluation of numbers; Population descriptions allow us to make predictions for the entire pop from a sample; Allows us to estimate an unknown value (ex BV)
^1676416587785

Sample statistics::Allows us to make predictions for entire pop from a sample; Should not be biased (large, random, diverse, etc.); Inferences from a pop; Ex: Allows you to infer weaning wgt in pop of Hereford cattle
^1676416587798

Why do we need to measure traits?::Variation  (measure of distribution); "Raw material" breeder has available for herd improvement
^1676416587807

Discontinuous variation::Qualitative traits (few, discrete genes); Phenotype not greatly influenced by env
^1676416587814

Continuous variation::Quantitative traits (polygenic; many genes); May involve many small graduations that are almost imperceptible to one another; Usually economically important traits; Highly complex
^1676416587821

Population parameter::A number that describes the population; Numerical descriptive measure for a pop; Ex: pop mean & variance (man = avg; variance = spread around the mean); Samples provide estimate of pop parameters
^1676416587830

Sample statistics involve numerical descriptive measures for a ---::sample Estimate of pop parameters
^1676416587837

Central Tendency::In normal distribution, values are clustered at the midpoint (of a range of values), thinning out symmetrically toward both extremes; Ex: bell curve
^1676416587845

Shifting the curve::Can move the mean of values in pos or neg direction through selection
^1676416587852

Biological measurements tend to be ---::normally distributed
^1676416587860

Median::Value halfway between two extreme values
^1676416587867

Mode::Class w/ the highest frequency; Value that appears the most
^1676416587873

Mean::Avg of all the measurements in the pop; From a sample; Most useful stat for estimating central tendency in most pops; Samples from a normally distributed pop may show departure from normality
^1676416587879

Mean formula::Avg X = (Sigma X)/n; (+ n1 n2 n3 ...) / total # of values
^1676416587887

Variance (s^2)::Measure of distribution (division about the mean); Define as the avg squared deviation of observations from their mean; Sqrt variance = standard deviation
^1676416587894

S^2 =::$Variance = s^{2} = \frac{\sum (X - \bar{X})^{2}}{n-1}$
^1676416587901

To compute variance, each observation in a pop sample first has the mean ---::subtracted; These deviations from the mean are then squared and summed; This sum of squared deviations is then divided by n-1
^1676416587907

Variance can be used to compare between ---::different populations; Ex: Comparing variance between Berry's cows and UGA's cows; Only useful if you are looking at several pops
^1676416587914

Standard Deviation (s)::"Typical" deviation, in abs value, of an observation drawn at random from the pop, from its mean; s = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(s^2)
^1676416587920

Standard deviation allows you to get a range of values around the mean; Individuals outside of this range may have problems

Haw can s be used?::Standard deviation can describe variance in a pop (s = s^2); Helps us picture how much variation actually exists for a trait
^1676416587927

Standard Error::How accurately the mean has been estimated; If the mean is computed again from a different sample of n individuals (drawn at random from the same pop), how closely would the new estimate of the mean correspond to the former one?
^1676416587933

Standard Error Formula::SE = SD/sqrt(n)
^1676416587940

[[2023-02-16]]
Correlation measures the strength of the relationship between ---::two variables; Is one trait of an animal associated w/ another?
^1676595072374

Correlation ex::Is height at withers in beef cattle associated w/ body length?; Is weight of a dairy cow related to amount of milk produced?
^1676595072390

Correlation coefficient r measures the degree of ---::association (or tightness) between two variables (traits) in a sample from a population; Range = -1.0-+1.0
^1676595072398

Correlation of +1.0 indicates that for each standard unit increase in one variable, there is a ---::standard unit increase in the correlated trait; Strong positive correlation
^1676595072405

A significant correlation (statistically speaking) means that there is ---::a high probability of a real associated between the traits; Indicated by a star
^1676595072413

Correlation Range::Low = r = 0.1-0.2; Medium = r = 0.21 = 0.4; High = r = 0.41-0.99
^1676595072421

Correlation is created by ---::gene linkage and pleiotropy; One of these is responsible for any correlation between traits
^1676595072429

Correlation is ---::unitless; Unlike regression, which takes on the unit of the trait
^1676595072438

Correlation cannot be used to predict the ---::level of one variable based on the second; No basis for cause and effect determination; Correlation does not automatically indicate causation; r proves no evidence as to which variable is the cause and which is the effect
^1676595072445

Correlation Coefficient Formula::$r = \frac{\sum XY - \frac{\sum X\sum Y}{N}}{\sqrt[2](({\sum X^{2} - \frac{(\sum X^{2})}{N})(\sum Y^{2}-\frac{(\sum Y)^{2}}{N}))}}$
^1676595072454

When solving correlation, list ---:Xs and Ys first then list XYs then list X^2s and Y^2s; After listing these values, find the sums and plug into the formula (don't forget to sqrt the denominator); Result should always fall within -1.0 to +1.0[

Ex and animal correlations::Correlation between fleece weight in lambs and weaning wgt; Correlation between scrotal circumference and age at puberty in cattle
^1676595072462

Phenotypic correlation::Measures the strength of relationship between performance (phenotypic value) in one trait and performance in another; $r_p$ = phenotypic correlation
^1676595072470

Genetic correlation::Measures the strength of relationship between BV for one trait and BV for the other; More important than phenotypic correlation bc of selection for one trait leads to selection on another trait; $r_g$ = genetic correlation
^1676595072477

Ex: feed conversion and wgt gain in swine::r between SC at age of puberty is -0.9; If breeder selects for large SC in bulls, they can expect to have younger age at puberty for both male and female offspring
^1676595072484

Env correlation::measure of strength of relationship between env effects and traits; Often used for management purposes;  $r_e$ = env correlation 
^1676595072492

Ex: env correlation between avg daily gain and back fat thickness is +0.4::Suggest that env is conductive for rapid weight gain to produce fatter pigs
^1676595072498

Regression Coefficient::Measures the change in Y response per unit change in X within the given range of values; Regression can be used to predict one value based on another (unlike correlation); Can be + or -; Has representative units for the traits of interest
^1676595072505

Regression Formula::$\frac{\sum XY - \frac{\sum X\sum Y}{n}}{\sum X^{2}-\frac{(\sum X)^{2}}{n}}$
^1676595072512

The regression formula is just one part of the correlation formula::Regression = $\frac{\sum XY - \frac{\sum X\sum Y}{n}}{\sum X^{2}-\frac{(\sum X)^{2}}{n}}$  Correlation = $r = \frac{\sum XY - \frac{\sum X\sum Y}{N}}{\sqrt[2](({\sum X^{2} - \frac{(\sum X^{2})}{N})(\sum Y^{2}-\frac{(\sum Y)^{2}}{N}))}}$  The numerator is the same and the denominator just contains the first segment in regression (no sqrt either)
^1676595072518

Formula for q frequency over many generations::$F_{o}=\frac{F_{0}}{1 + (N)(F_{o})}$  where $F_{o}$ is the frequency of the recessive allele (q) and N is the number of generations
^1676597803403

[[2023-02-18]]
Regression Slope Formula::**Y (^ predicted) = a + bX**  *or*  **Y (^ predicted) = bX + a**  *or*  **a = Y (- mean) - bX (- mean)**; b = slope (regression coefficient); a = y-int; X = independent variable; Y = dependent variable
^1676765907425

b = slope or the --- coefficient in the formula Y = bX + a::regression; The greater the slope, the greater the association between two traits; b = 0 indicates no association while b = 0.7 would indicate close association (over same scale as correlation)
^1676765907438

When referring to regression, X is the --- variable::independent; X is the X observation and X (- mean) is the avg of the X observations; Determines what will happen to Y (the dependent variable)
^1676765907445

When determining X (- mean) from the X observations, more --- is better::observations; Finds the degree of variation among observations (less variation is better)
^1676765907453

Regression is more useful than --- bc you can make predictions::correlation; However, regression is *not* applicable outside range of values used and must be specific to population from which samples are taken
^1676765907459

Regression is the avg or expected change in variable Y per unit change in ---::X; Both variables are expressed in terms of their original units of measure; $b_{yx}$ = regression of Y on X
^1676765907466

When working w/ regression, there is an assumption of ---::cause and effect; Variation in trait X influences variation in trait Y; X = "cause" variable (independent) while Y = "effect" variable (dependent)
^1676765907474

Regression c&e ex: weaning wgt in cattle::*Age* is the *cause* of variation in *weight*; Age = X; Weight = Y; Y (weaning wgt) = a + b (regression coef) * X (age)
^1676765907481

Regression is used when we want to predict the ---::numerical value of one trait from the phenotypic value of another; May be difficult or expensive to measure Y directly
^1676765907487

Regression predictions ex: yield grade or cutability for pork carcasses::Determining regression allows you to predict the yield grade before you cut in; Better to predict Y than measure Y directly
^1676765907494

If the estimate of regression of fleece wgt at the 60 day weaning wgt in lambs is 0.04 lb per 1 lb, then ---::for every lb increase in weaning wgt, there will be a 0.04 lb increase in fleece wgt; Can use this to make decisions about which animals to cull and which to keep (selection of the parents of the next generation)
^1676765907501

If regression of BV for age at puberty and that of SC in cattle is -8.5 days per cm, then ---::for every cm in SC, the progeny of that animal will reach puberty 8.5 days earlier
^1676765907508

[[2023-02-21]]
Selection (1st strategy for genetic change)::Deciding which individuals to retain as parents that will contribute genes to subsequent generations; Helps us change *allelic frequencies*
^1677024194313

The goal of selection is to increase the frequency of ----::alleles with desirable effects and decrease freq of alleles w/ undesirable effects
^1677024194317

Mating systems (2nd strategy for genetic change)::Which males mated to which females; Does *not* change allelic freq, only *genotype* frequencies
^1677024194322

Mating systems alter genotypic frequencies or the proportion of ---::homo vs hetero in offspring generation; Application of MS leads to further changes in allelic frequencies beyond that of selection
^1677024194327

Random Mating Systems::HWE requires a randomly mating pop; Constant freq from gen to gen; Genotypic frequencies depend upon allelic frequencies (p + q = 1 (allelic) and p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.0 (genotypic))
^1677024194331

Non-Random Mating Systems::Involves strategies for genetic change; Selection generally has a goal in mind (Do we want animals that are more related? less related? look alike? tall? red coat?)
^1677024194335

Assignment of mates in NRMS can be based on ---::Genetic relationship (inbreeding vs outbreeding) or phenotypic similarity (similar vs different)
^1677024194340

NRMS based on genetic relationship::Based on pedigree; Involves inbreeding and outbreeding; Can use arrow diagrams to represent the flow of genes
^1677024194344

NRMS based on phenotypic similarity::Based on performance; Mate the male and female bc they either resemble one another more closely for a trait than if chosen at random from the pop (positive assortative mating) or resemble one another less closely (disassortative/negative assortative mating)
^1677024194349

Inbreeding::Mating of individuals that are *more closely related* than the avg of the pop (sire and dam are genetically related); Increase in homozygosity (frequency of homo genotypes); Can cause inbreeding depression
^1677024194352

Inbreeding depression::Decline in performance due to inbreeding and the increase in homozygosity
^1677024194357

Inbreeding as the attempt to make individuals more ---::homozygous for superior genes of ancestor
^1677024194361

Inbreeding coefficient::The probability that two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent; Reflection of increased prop of homo loci in an individual
^1677024194365

The degree of inbreeding (inbreeding coef) is quantified by ---::$F_{x}$; Measures the percent increase in homo gene pairs in the individual relative to the avg of the breed
^1677024194370

If an individual has an Fx of 0.25, what does this tell you?::Fx value for most herd of livestock will *not* be more than 0.5, so 0.25 is a probable value
^1677024194374

The more closely related the pair in NRMS, the more severe the ---::inbreeding
^1677024194378

When representing the flow of genes through time, we can convert pedigrees to ---::arrow diagrams
^1677024194382

Arrow diagram rules::Individuals may appear only once; Arrows run from ancestors to descendants; Each arrow leading away from an individual represents a Mendelian segregation of genes (sample of half of each parent's genes are transmitted to offspring)
^1677024194387

Pedigree vs Arrow diagram (ex #1)::![[index.jpg]]
^1677024194393

Pedigree vs Arrow diagram (ex #2)::![[Pasted image 20230220143254.png]]
^1677024194399

In general, a common ancestor is an ancestor common to more than one individual. When talking about inbreeding, a common ancestor refers to ---::an ancestor common to parents of an inbred
^1677024194403

Ex of inbreeding depression vs outbreeding::![[Pasted image 20230220104414.png]]
^1677024194409

Outbreeding::Mating of individuals that are *less closely related* than the avg of the pop; Increase in heterozygosity; Hybrid vigor (heterosis)
^1677024194414

Hybrid Vigor::The superior performance of crossbred offspring (AKA heterosis)
^1677024194419

Outbreeding is most often used in commercial ---::meat animal production
^1677024194424

Positive assortative mating::Mating individuals that resemble one another more closely for a trait than if chosen at random from the pop; Ex: red coat to red coat; tall w/ tall; Leads to increase in homozygosity and similar effects to inbreeding (such as inbreeding depression)
^1677024194429

Negative assortative mating::Mating individuals that resemble one another less closely for a trait than if chosen at random from the pop; Leads to increase in heterozygosity; Can see similar genetic effects as outbreeding (such as heterosis)
^1677024194435

NRMS Summary::Does *not* alter allelic frequencies (goal of NRMS is to alter genotypic frequencies); Inbreeding & positive assortative mating increases homozygosity while outbreeding & negative assortative mating increases heterozygosity 
^1677024194441

[[2023-02-23]]
When using an arrow diagram to represent the flow of genes from A to X, S and D can inherit identical copies of ---::a gene from A; X can then inherit that gene from both S and D (homozygous); Therefore, the gene is *identical by descent* 
^1677206664172

Genes can become identical by descent as inbreeding results in ---::an increase in homozygosity beyond what would be found in a randomly mating pop
^1677206664183

Animals can have alleles that are "alike in state", which refers to ---::having the same alleles (HH) but *not* traceable to a common ancestor (as compared to identical by descent)
^1677206664189

Linebreeding::Less intense form of inbreeding; Concentrates genes of one common ancestor by mating individuals from a particular line
^1677206664196

Linebreeding is designed to maintain a substantial degree of ---::relationship to highly regarded ancestor; This is often used in the horse industry
^1677206664203

Effects of Inbreeding::Prepotency; Expression of detrimental recessive alleles; Inbreeding Depression; Tends to "fix" traits within a pop; Concentrates genes; Increases P of getting similar genes to offspring from ancestor
^1677206664209

Prepotency::Performance of offspring is especially like that of the parent (uniform); Less offspring variation; Attempt to make individuals more homo for superior genes; The degree to which an animal will pass his or her characteristics consistently
^1677206664216

Expression of detrimental recessive alleles gives --- a bad reputation::inbreeding; Does *not* create deleterious recessive alleles, only increased *expression* of detrimental genes; Does *not* increase frequency of detrimental alleles (MS only change genotypic frequency)
^1677206664223

Inbreeding depression is seen in --- traits::quantitative; In polygenic traits, individual effects of genes are small but together can decrease performance; Decrease in performance of inbreds for traits like fertility and survivability
^1677206664230

Inbreeding depression can lead to unfavorable --- value::gene combination; Result of increased homozygosity; Change in *genotypic* frequency
^1677206664237

Not all quantitative traits are equally affected by ---::inbreeding depression; Repro and health - seriously affected; Production - moderately affected; Product quality - little affected
^1677206664244

Measuring inbreeding::Sewel Wright; $$Fx = \sum_{n=1}^{k}(1/2)^{n1+n2+1}(1 + Fa)$$
^1677206664250

In the inbreeding formula, Fx represents the ---:: inbreeding coef of individual X
^1677206664256

In the inbreeding formula, N represents the ---::num of segregations of genes (matings) between common ancestors and S and D of X; n1 = num of generations separating common ancestor from sire of X; n2 = num of generations separating the common ancestor from the dam of X
^1677206664263

In the inbreeding formula, Fa represents the ---::inbreeding coef of the common ancestor
^1677206664269

In the inbreeding formula, k represents the ---::number of common ancestors
^1677206664276

Measuring inbreeding - Ex: #1::![[Pasted image 20230222103723.png]]Number of generations separating X from both Sire and Dam is 1; No relationship is shown behind A, so the inbreeding coef is just 0; (1/2) to the third power multiplied by (1 + 0) is simply (1/2) to the third power
^1677206664283

Measuring inbreeding - Ex: #2::![[Pasted image 20230222104216.png]]Interpretation: About 3% of individual X's genes are coming from ancestor A
^1677206664289

Measuring inbreeding - Ex: #3::![[Pasted image 20230222104634.png]]A Sire x Daughter Mating produces 0.25 for Fx
^1677206664297

Measuring inbreeding - Ex: #4::![[Pasted image 20230222104939.png]]Fx = 0; Would only have two common ancestors if both A and B were related to the sire
^1677206664305

[[2023-02-25]]
Measuring inbreeding - Ex: #5::![[Pasted image 20230224101138.png]]Involves two common ancestors, so after following the formula for each, sum them together; Reminder: Fx will *never* be greater than 0.5
^1677342500888

Within Breed (Outbreeding)::Involves crossing inbred lines; Still results in heterosis, but not as dramatic as when you cross outside of the breed; Crossing animals of different families within the same breed
^1677342500897

Outbreeding within a breed is often seen in the --- industry::poultry; Several strains/lines of one breed; Within each line, intense selection for economically important traits; Over time, animals become genetically distinct
^1677342500906

Outbreeding within a breed ex::A, B, C, and D represent four different lines/strains; A x B offspring are 50% A and 50% B while C x D offspring are 50% C and 50% D; AB x CD offspring  are then line ABCD (25% each); ABCD becomes the commercial line
^1677342500912

Grading Up (AKA Topcrossing; Outbreeding)::Mating purebred males that are superior to non-purebred females (grade); Attempt to create a purebred population
^1677342500919

Grading Up/Topcrossing ex::Angus male x Brangus female; If Angus male is 100% A and Brangus female is 50% A and 50% B, offspring of cross are 75% A and 25% B; Then cross 100% A w/ 75:25 offspring to get offspring that are 87.5% A and 12.5% B; Then cross 100% A w/ 87.5:12.5 to get 93.75% A and 6.35% B offspring
^1677342500925

Crossbreeding (Outbreeding)::The crossing of different breeds; Ex: Duroc male x Landrace female combines good maternal qualities of Landrace w/ characteristics of Duroc
^1677342500931

Species crosses (Outbreeding)::Closely related species can be mixed; Ex: Horse (64) x Donkey (62) = mule (63; can't mate bc chromosomes can't pair normally at meiosis); Ex: cattle x bison creates "beefalo"
^1677342500938

Species cross ex::Bos taurus (European) x Bos indicus; Important for beef production in Southern US bc Angus (B. taurus) x Brahman (B. indicus) creates Brangus; Combines growth rate, carcass attributes of Angus w/ hardiness and adaptability to hot, humid conditions of Brahman
^1677342500944

Effects of Outbreeding::Does *not* eliminate detrimental rec alleles (perpetuates them by masking expression); Phenotypic effects = heterosis (hybrid vigor)
^1677342500950

Heterosis (hybrid vigor) official definition::The superiority, for many traits, of the offspring from outbred matings, in comparison to the avg phenotypic merit of offspring from random matings within the pop contributing to the cross
^1677342500956

The opposite of inbreeding depression is ---::heterosis (hybrid vigor) as seen when outbreeding
^1677342500963

Heterosis refers to the superiority of the ---::crossbred to the purebred parents in many traits overall; Observed heterosis is the superior net effect of such influences at all loci affecting the trait
^1677342500970

Heterosis can also be defined as the degree of superiority of the outbred offspring for ---::a particular trait as compared to the avg of the parental line or breed
^1677342500976

Heterosis is the difference between the avg of all crossbreds in comparison to the ---::avg of all purebreds contributing to the crosses
^1677342500983

% Heterosis = --::((mean of F1 offspring  -  mean of parent breeds) / mean of parent breeds)  x 100
^1677342500992

Heterosis 150 day calf weight ex::Angus purebred avg = 336; Hereford purebred avg = 334; A (dam) x H (sire) avg = 372; H (dam) x A (sire) avg = 366; 34 lb difference between avg of crossbreds and purebreds; (366 + 372)/2 = 369 (avg of crossbreeds); (336 + 334)/2 = 335 (avg of purebreds); (369 - 335)/335 = 10% difference between crosbreeds and parent breeds; 369 - 335 = 34
^1677342501001

Crossbreeding should be the MS of choice for overall --- of production::efficiency; Sometimes, however, it is not (ex dairy cattle production in the US)
^1677342501010

The dairy industry is an exemption to the usual affects of ---::crossbreeding; No breed when crossed w/ Holstein produces a F1 generation w/ a fluid milk yield exceeding that of straightbred Holsteins; Although crossbred cows do produce more milk than the avg of straightbreds contributing to the cross; H x H (7000 kg); J x J (5000 kg); Average purebreds (6000 kg); H x J (6300 kg)
^1677342501018

Additive Genetic Relationship::Proportion of genes that two individuals have in common; Describes the genetic likeness of the two individuals in question
^1677342501025

Additive Genetic Relationship is measured using a numerical value from ---::0 to 1; Since AGR is a probability, it must be within this range; Two animals can have anywhere from none to all genes identical by descent
^1677342501033

Ex of Additive Genetic Relationship::Holstein cows have more genes in common w/ other Holsteins than Jerseys
^1677342501041

By looking at genetic relationships, we attempt to quantify the ---::*proportion of genes* within two individuals that are *identical by descent*
^1677342501049

Computing Rxy (the relationship of x and y)::$Rxy = \frac{\sum 1/2^{n}(1+Fa)}{\sqrt{(1+Fx)(1+Fy)}}$
^1677342501059

 [[2023-03-02]]
 Breed complementation (outbreeding)::Combining the desirable characteristics of two or more breeds (or lines) into the same offspring; Ex: Brangus
^1677826246701

In breed complementation, one breed in a cross can be chosen partially to compensate for ---::deficiencies of another breed
^1677826246712

Breed compensation ex: commercial beef cattle producers in VA::Maintain herd of Angus (which have good maternal traits and marbling); Calves of Angus ancestry sell for higher prices than calves without; Must choose sires that will compliment Angus by increasing growth size and muscling of crossbred calves (many choose Charolais or Simmental); Breed complementation and heterosis both contribute to herd efficiency
^1677826246719

Marbling, or intramuscular fat, is necessary for ---::carcass to grade choice under USDA grading standards; Genetic potential for marbling is important in establishing market value of feeder cattle
^1677826246728

The degree of heterosis and breed complimentary depends on ---::genetic relationship of parents and heritability
^1677826246735

Less closely related parents result in crossbreds w/ greater ---::heterosis; Ex: bos taurus x b. indicus tend to be superior to b. taurus x b. taurus
^1677826246743

Angus is bos --- while brahman is bos ---::taurus; indicus; Bos indicus breeds have humps and extended dewlaps
^1677826246749

Crossing highly inbred lines of two breeds of swine results in offspring that express --- heterosis than non-inbred lines of the same breed::greater
^1677826246756

Heritability measures the strength of the relationship between performance (phenotypic values) and ---::BV (genotypic) for a trait in a pop; low = < 0.2; mod = 0.21-0.4; high = > 0.41
^1677826246763

If a trait is highly heritable, then heterosis is ---::low; If traits lowly heritable, greater heterosis
^1677826246769

Fertility and repro traits are more lowly heritable so they experience --- heterosis::greater; Respond more to crossbreeding
^1677826246777

Growth traits are moderately to highly heritable, so they experience --- heterosis::lower; Respond less to crossbreeding
^1677826246784

Selection works well w/ traits that are --- heritable::highly; Outbreeding takes advantage of heterosis and complimentary in lowly heritable traits
^1677826246791

Heritability to heterosis in traits graph::![[Pasted image 20230301102839.png]]
^1677826246798

In general, maximum (optimum) production uses crossbreeding in --- species::meat
^1677826246805

In commercial cow/calf operations, almost all commercial cows are ---::crossbred; Ex: Black Baldy = H x A (common beef animal in US)
^1677826246813

Outbreeding in Swine::Extensive crossing of *inbred lines and breeds* to maximize *repro and growth* (maternal lines)
^1677826246820

Reciprocal Recurrent Selection::System of selection for increasing the combining ability of two or more lines (or breeds) that have demonstrated from past crosses that they combine well
^1677826246826

Reciprocal recurrent selection develops superior --- lines::inbred; Crossing more genetically diverse lines of two breeds to create superior stock
^1677826246834

General Combining Ability (GCA)::Refers to the *performance* of a breed for a particular trait in a *series of crosses*
^1677826246848

Ex: GCA for Angus when looking at weaning wgt::Angus x Brahman; Angus x Hereford; Angus x Limousin; Angus x Beefmaster; List weaning wgt data for multiple crosses to determine GCA of Angus
^1677826246855

Specific Combining Ability (SCA)::Looks at a specific cross to determine the performance of a breed for a particular trait; Ex: SCA for Angus x Hereford when looking at weaning wgt
^1677826246863

The net result of selecting parents of best performing offspring to have the next generation is the development of ---::genetically diverse inbred lines; Better performing crossed lines that express greater heterosis; Inbred lines can then be crossed w/ inbred lines of other breeds
^1677826246870

Outbreeding in Poultry::Meat breeds use crossbreeding for growth advantages; Ex: white cornish male x white plymouth rock female (WCM has good growth and meat characterstics while WPR has good maternal characteristics)
^1677826246877

Outbreeding in Sheep::Seen in meat breeds (down breeds like Suffolk and Hampshire); Ex: Rambouillet ewes (can breed in summer for winter lambing) x Suffolk or Hampshire rams (good growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass merit) (choice of R ewe is dictated by demands of env)
^1677826246886

Outbreeding in Dairy::Outcrossing within breeds but rarely between breeds; Economic reason = we have established very specific parameters for value of product (H has high production but low fat while J has high fat but lower production; advantages of crossing = hybrid vigor and complementation; disadvantage = may negatively affect milk or fat w/ regard to market)
^1677826246893

In poultry, there is extensive line-crossing w/ laying hens; Crossing egg layer by broiler (meat) won't meet either objective (doesn't improve milk or egg production)

Wool breeds of sheep show little advantage in ---::crossbreeding; Little response to heterosis; Heritability of most wool traits is mod to high
^1677826246900

When looking at systems of crossbreeding, we must define ---, ---, ---, and ---::objectives (traits of interest? Level of heterosis? Level of complimentary?); breeds (compatibility? Quality? Continuous supply?); herd size (larger, better the results but more costly); performance of reciprocal crosses (maternal vs paternal breed); Crossbred offspring are more expensive
^1677826246907

When determining the performance of reciprocal crosses, look at the env and mothering ability (such as milk production); Ex: beef cattle in desert area - Male H x Female B vs Male B vs Female H; H x H = poor performance; B x B = similar performance to Male B x Female H

Maternal swine breeds are usually ---, while paternal swine breeds are usually ---::Yorkshire, Landrace, and Chester White;    Duroc, Hampshire, and Spots; Ex of how we predict performance of reciprocal crosses

Terminal System::All offspring of terminal system sold into the market; Easiest system of crossbreeding![[Pasted image 20230303102652.png]]
^1678053351887

Downside of terminal system::You do not keep replacement animals; Always need provision of replacement females; Must purchase; Need reliable, healthy, and economic source
^1678053351896

Advantages of terminal system::You can produce uniform offspring; Heterosis is maximized (direct heterosis in F1 crossbred offspring); Breed complementation; Easy 
^1678053351901

Ex of two breed terminal cross::Rambouillet ewe (maternal traits and env adaptability) x Suffolk ram (growth rate and carcass merit); Offspring go to market (none retained); Direct heterosis and complementation (but does not benefit from maternal heterosis)
^1678053351906

In the 1950s, herefords were the dominant breed of beef cattle in the western US; Adapted to region, good demand for feeder calves; ranches began calving heifers at 2 yrs vs 3; Coupled w/ selection for bulls for growth (caused dystocia); Solution = mated first calf H heifers to angus bulls (angus known to produce low birthweight cows); But still needed H heifers as replacements so for 2nd and subsequent matings, H cows mated to H bulls (provision of desired purebred H replacement females)

Three Breed Terminal Crosses::F1 crossbred females from two maternal breeds mated to males of sire breed (sires chosen for growth and carcass traits); Genetically superior to two breeds; Utilizes both maternal and direct heterosis; Increased breed complementation
^1678053351911

Maternal traits include ---::Adaptability to env; High merit for reproduction; Milk production; Mothering ability
^1678053351916

Drawback to Three Terminal Cross::Must purchase replacement females or keep separate herd for seedstock
^1678053351921

Rotational Crossbreeding System::Involves rotating between two or more breeds; Allows production of herd replacements; Downside is that all animals are crossbred at some point
^1678053351927

[[2023-03-06]]
Two breed rotation ex::1st year - A x B = AB; 2nd yr - AB x A = AB; 3rd yr - AB x B = AB; Rotating between two breeds
^1678214721952

Three breed rotation ex::1st yr - A x B = AB; 2nd yr - AB x C = ABC; 3rd yr - ABC x A = ABC; 4th yr - ABC x B = ABC; Rotating between three breeds
^1678214721961

When using rotational crossbreeding system, all animals will eventually be ---::crossbred; Different levels of ages and gene combinations as well; Decrease in uniformity
^1678214721968

Rotational system of crossbreeding involves more investment than ---::terminal system
^1678214721975

In rotational systems, original purebred dams will be replaced by ---::crossbred descendants; Offspring and dams benefit from both direct and maternal heterosis, but *not maximum potential heterosis*
^1678214721983

Rotational systems do not benefit from maximum potential heterosis (like terminal systems) bc each breed is eventually used on both --- and --- sides of the cross::female; male; Offspring always inherit some proportion of non-heterotic gene combinations
^1678214721990

Four breed rotational systems retain more --- than two or three breed systems::heterosis; Less popular bc more complex to manage and easier to find just two or three breeds that compliment well
^1678214721997

In terminal crossbreeding, you can choose maternal and paternal breeds for sire and dam, but in rotational, ---::you cannot bc each breed is used as sire and dam
^1678214722005

Terminal crosses have more uniform offspring than in --- systems::rotational; In rotational, overlap of generations within herd at any one time; Results in different aged females belonging to different generations
^1678214722012

Two breed rotational ex: Angus x Hereford::Some cows 2/3 A and 1/3 H; Others 1/3 A and 2/3 H; Produce calves that are 2/3 A and 2/3 H; Variability in calf crop vs calf crop in terminal crossbreeding program
^1678214722018

In rotational systems, each female must be mated to appropriate ---::sire breed; She needs permanent ID; Results in increased labor and management 
^1678214722025

Rotaterminal System of Crossbreeding::Compromise between rotational and terminal systems; Uses rotational among maternal breeds to produce replacement gilts for terminal matings
^1678214722033

Rotaterminal systems use rotational crossbreeding among ---::2-3 maternal breeds to create replacement females for terminal matings; Also produces males from this rotational segment , but not good market animals
^1678214722039

Rotaterminal systems involves more investment than ---::both terminal and rotational systems; Uniformity is also a challenge (different ages of animals)
^1678214722046

The 1st few cycles of females in rotaterminal systems breed to sire of maternal breeds to reduce ---::dystocia; Terminal sire breeds produce large offspring (selected for growth rate); This alleviates this issue
^1678214722053

After a few matings to maternal sires in rotaterminal systems, the females are bred to ---::terminal sires
^1678214722059

Advantages of rotaterminal system is that you can both ---::sell terminal animals and keep replacement animals 
^1678214722066

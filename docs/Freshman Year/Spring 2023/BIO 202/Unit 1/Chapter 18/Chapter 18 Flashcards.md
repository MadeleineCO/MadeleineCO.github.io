Many scientists influenced Darwin::Darwin looked at other scientist's work; Most were staunch creationists who ascribed to fixity of species
^1673481276383

Fixity of species::Held by creationists; *Scala naturae* --> Rungs of ladder; Animals differ by complexity; Species are perfect as just as they are
^1673481276398

Georges-Louis Leclerc::18th century naturalist; Posited evidence of evolution while studying environmental and survival struggle; Was never all in, so studies little beyond thought experiments
^1673481276406

Carl Linnaeus::18th century physician & botanist; Created binomial nomenclature naming scheme (genus + species); Devised hierarchical classification (DKPCOFGS); Accepted fixity and creation
^1673481276413

DKPCOFGS::Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species; From inclusive to exclusive
^1673481276419

Baron George Cuvier::Late 18th century zoologist; Accepted fixity of species; Created paleontolgy (study of prehistoric life); After looking at comparative anatomy & fossils, he became 1st to suggest organism extinction
^1673481276427

Strata & fossils indicate that ---::things changed; Strata = layers of soil (singular - stratum); Baron George Cuvier devised idea of catastrophism (catastrophic events wiped out animals) by looking at these
^1673481276434

James Hutton & Charles Lyell::Prominent geologists that devised uniformitarianism (slow & continuous changes in past of present); This idea is still accepted today and stands in contrast to Cuvier's catastrophism; Rates of change vary
^1673481276440

Thomas Malthus::18th century economist that studied human demography; Population size influenced by food, water, shelter, famine, war, and epidemics
^1673481276447

Carrying capacity::How large of a population can the environment sustain?; When you reach carrying capacity, problems occur from an overstretched population; Studied by Malthus
^1673481276454

Jean-Baptist de Lamarck::Late 18th century biologist who created 1st testable hypothesis of evolution; Inheritance of acquired traits (less complex --> more complex; environment --> physical changes); Did not infer genetic change and process from Darwin (although same result); Short necked giraffes --> long-necked
^1673481276461

Darwin's early career::19th century naturalist; At first, a staunch creationist; Worked in geology & botany
^1673481276468

Darwin's famous trip::Travelled aboard the *HMS Beagle* to the Southern hemisphere over 5 yrs; Observed geological change, fossils and extinction; Concluded that Earth was older than originally thought; Enough time --> Modification
^1673481276475

Alfred Wallace::19th century naturalist; Similar theory to Darwin's; Studied the Malay Archipelago; Sent his paper to Darwin (which led to D publishing paper earlier than expected)
^1673481276481

Darwin's Voyage::Darwin meant to be company for *HMS Beagle* captain but during trip made many observations about the geographic distribution of organisms and adaptions
^1673554835258

Geographic distribution of organisms::Incremental geological changes; Present day informs about past
^1673554835269

Galapagos Islands::Mainland too far for colonization; D observed remarkable diversity & unity; Tortoises and finches
^1673554835275

Darwin's ground finches::Gould later Id'd the birds as "ground finches"; All had different beaks to suit different diets; Different forms --> different niches; New species relative to EU finches and derived from one SA ancestor
^1673554835281

LaMark believed in ---::inheritance of acquired traits; Short necked giraffes --> giraffes "lengthen" necks to create long-necked giraffes; Passed onto subsequent generations; Phenotype changed genotype (incorrect)
^1673554835288

Darwin believed in ---::decent w/ modification; Giraffe population was variable so short and long-necked giraffes existed; Long-necked giraffes outcompeted so more long-necked in offspring and population; Short-necked eventually disappeared; Genetics in pop before but long-necked dominated (more successful)
^1673554835294

[[2023-01-16]]
Darwinian reflections after his trip::Species are not fixed and most change through time
^1673883490268

On *The Origin of Species*::Wallace sent his paper to Darwin in 1858; Lyell encouraged Darwin to publicize his ideas; Darwin published *The Origin of Species* in 1859
^1673883490280

Basis of natural selection::Organisms exhibit heritable variation; Organisms compete for resources and some may be outcompeted; Individuals vary w/ repro success and populations may adapt w/ environmental changes
^1673883490287

Individual organisms do not change more than ---::it is able w/ it's set of genes, but across a population, changes may occur
^1673883490293

Mechanisms for modification::Variation through genes; Selective pressure at individual levels (does affect individuals as some will live while others may not)
^1673883490299

Genes are the unit of ---::heredity; Alleles are variations of genes; Passed to offspring and may be selected for or against
^1673883490306

Natural selection uses ---::competition; Limited resources are available and population increases while resources decrease; Individuals will die
^1673883490312

Natural selection and fitness::Repro success is relative to others; Increased repro success = increased ability to spread genes (more fit --> spread more genes)
^1673883490318

Males are often more brightly colored for ---::sexual selection; Purpose is for them to spread their genes to the next generation
^1673883490325

Adaption::Evolved trait --> better suited to the environment; Result of natural selection
^1673883490330

Fossil Evidence for evolution::Fossils = remains or traces of past life; The process is rare but chances increase w/ time; Fossilization requires specific conditions (whole organism, usually follows floods or volcanic events); Switches living tissue for minerals (ex bones)
^1673883490337

Homologous structures::Anatomically similar structures that were inherited from a common ancestor (ex vertebrate forelimbs and phalanges)
^1673883490344

Analogous structures::Anatomically similar structures that originated independently; Multiple times; Ex: animal flight (birds, pterosaurs, and bats all developed flight separately); Ex: shape of aquatic animals
^1673883490350

Vestigial structures::Remnants from a previous ancestor that remain in derived species; Important for ancestor but no longer important for derived species; Ex: pelvic girdle in snakes/whales
^1673883490356

All living organisms have ---::DNA; Main holder of genetic info; DNA --> RNA --> Protein; Unifying factor of all life
^1673883490363

Cytochrome-c protein::Cytochrome is used for the ETC; Similar AA in eukaryotes (monkeys are 1AA different from humans, 11AA different from ducks, and 51AA different from yeast); Still all cytochrome functionally
^1673883490369

Antibiotic resistance in bacteria; Staph aureus is common in skin flora of 1/3 of people; Already had genes for resistance and expressed penicillin resistance by 1945 and methicillin resistance by 1961; Changes observable in years; Selects for bacteria that are most likely to resist antibiotic

Biogeographical evidence for evolution::Similarities in global strata (all continents were connected); Marsupials in Australia (only found in SA/Australia bc placental mammals dominated in other regions but Australia has been isolated longer so marsupials there weren't outcompeted)
^1673883490375

Misconception: Evolution is just a theory::Theories must be repeatedly tested and supported --> principle of biology; Does not mean its infallible or cannot change
^1673883490381

Misconception: Individuals in a population evolve::Evolution results from changes in genetic composition over generations at a populational level; Individual change is growth/development
^1673883490387

Misconception: Evolution is a theory tied to origin of life::Does not directly relate to origin of life questions; Genetics must already be in population for evolution
^1673883490393

Misconception: Transitional fossils remain unknown; Well-known to scientists bc fossilization is rare; Most fossils that would fill in gaps will likely remain unknown

Misconception: Organisms evolve on purpose; Individuals do not evolve, but a population over generations might; The adaptive trait already exists in a population and natural selection then acts

Misconception: Random chance alone guides evolution::Chance is only a part of evolution of complex traits over time; Mutations occur randomly but selection does not occur randomly
^1673883490399

 Misconception: Evolution is not testable::By definition, it has been tested/retested 100s of times; Genetics and DNA technology has provided robust evidence
^1673883490405

Misconception: Humans evolved directly from apes::Humans (Homo sapiens) share an ancestor w/ modern apes; Ancestor is different from modern humans *and* monkeys
^1673883490412

[[2023-01-19]]
Species (bio)::Latin for "kind" or "appearance"; 20+ definitions based on research (biological, morphological, & ecological)
^1674164499765

Biological definition of a species::A group of populations of the same "kind" of organism that may naturally interbreed to produce viable offspring; Do *not* interbreed or produce viable offspring w/ a "different" kind
^1674164454223

A grizzly bear (*U. arctos*) and a polar bear (*U. maritimus*) can breed to create hybrid called a. . .::"grolar bear"; Not commonly seen but polar bears are coming more and more in contact w/ grizzly bears; The hybrid may be better than grizzly or polar in the area (competition); Shows the repro limitation of the species definition
^1674164454227

Limitations of biological species definition::Limited to reproductive definition (species shouldn't interbreed) but  hybrids may routinely occur naturally; Also does not apply to asexual reproducers
^1674164454231

Speciation::The formation of two species from one; Allopatric ("other homeland") or sympatric ("same homeland")
^1674164454234

Allopatric speciation::Occurs due to geographic isolation; Ex: lake water level drops, river forms as a barrier; Two new species result from geographic barriers
^1674164454238

Adaptive radiation (bio)::Quick expansion of one species into many species to fit new/different environmental conditions and niches; Ex: finches
^1674164499773

The mosquitofish exhibits --- speciation::allopatric; A barrier formed separating the mosquitofish; They experienced different pressures in different ponds as one had a predator and other didn't; Deep body depth developed for burst swimming to get away from predators; Long body depth developed for steady swimming in those w/ no predators
^1674164454241

The snapping shrimp exhibits --- speciation::allopatric; The isthmus of Panama formed gradually from 10 to 3 mya, separating the Atlantic from the Pacific; About 15 spp formed on Atlantic side and about 15 on Pacific side; Sister species in similar habitats that arose due to geographic barrier
^1674164454245

Sympatric speciation::When two new species result within the same area (no geographic isolation); Gene flow may be disrupted or gene flow may occur
^1674164454248

Polyploidy is very common in ---::plants; Occurs when there are more than two chromosome copies; Autopolyploid vs allopolyploid
^1674164454252

An autopolyploid condition can occur from a ---::cell division error; Ex: tetraploid cells must self-pollinate because they are isolated from other 2N plants (yields new species); Sympatric S.
^1674164454255

An allopolyploid condition results from ---::interbreeding species w/ different numbers of chromosome sets; Allopolyploid hybrids are often sterile but can undergo asexual reproduction (may later become fertile, create new species, and breed w/ each other); Sympatric S.
^1674164454258

Allopolyploid Ex (Sympatric S.)::Normal gamete from species A (n = 3) + Normal gamete from species B (n = 2) --> sexually sterile hybrid zygote (n = 5)
^1674164454261

Sexual selection (Sympatric S.)::Two different species often mate at different times of year or may use different colors, rituals, etc; Prevents mating of different species
^1674164454265

Lake Victoria cichlids exemplify ---::sexual selection; Speciation occurred 100,000 ya; Females select males of their own species (males differ by color in different light spectrums); Prevents cross-mating
^1674164454268

Habitat differentiation (Sympatric S.)::Different sub populations of species may exploit different resources, preventing crossing of their species
^1674164454271

Apple vs Blueberry maggot flies exhibit ---::habitat differentiation; Apple maggots are attracted to different food resources than blueberry maggots; Apples also develop faster (ex of temporal isolation as well)
^1674164454274

Prezygotic barriers include ---::habitat isolation, temporal isolation, behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation, and gametic isolation; Prezygotic = before the zygote
^1674164454278

Habitat isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Two species live in two different habitats within the same area, but encounters are rare; Prevents mating; Ex: Apple vs blueberry maggots
^1674164454281

Temporal isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Different species have different seasonality of breeding (day/night, spring/fall, etc.); Prevents mating; Ex: *Spilogale* spp (Western skunks breed in summer while Eastern breed in winter)
^1674164454285

Behavioral isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Different courtship rituals between species prevents mating; Male mating displays differ; Ex: many different Birds of Paradise (44 spp) w/ highly diverse dances
^1674164454288

Mechanical isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Mating may be attempted between different species but mismatched copulation; Prevents fertilization; Ex: *Bradybaena* spp (snail shell spirals & genital openings); Misalignment prevents exchange
^1674164454292

Gametic isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Disparate morphology of sperm between species serves as a physical or biochemical barrier; Even when multiple sperm or eggs are around, they don't fertilize one another (just match to species); Prevents fertilization; Ex: *Strongylocentrotus* spp. broadcasts spawning of gametes w/ purple & red urchin sperm protein but despite many gametes around, cross-fertilization does not occur
^1674164454295

Postzygotic barriers include ---::reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, or hybrid breakdown; Fertilization occurs and zygote forms, but hybrids do not last
^1674164454299

Reduced hybrid viability (postzygotic barrier)::Survivability of the hybrid is low; Ex: *Ensantina* spp (salamander hybrids fail to completely develop after zygote formation)
^1674164454302

Reduced hybrid fertility (postzygotic barrier)::Individual hybrids are sterile bc their chromosomal number differs; Ex: donkey (m w/ 62 chromosomes) + horse (f w/ 64 chromosomes) = mule (w/ 63 chromosomes but no fertility)
^1674164454306

Hybrid breakdown (postzygotic barrier)::When the 1st hybrid generation may be fertile but subsequent generations are not; Ex: rice hybrids carry a recessive allele and new generations accumulate the recessive allele so that the next generation is small/sterile
^1674164454309

Hybrid zones::The overlap of species where they can interact
^1674164454312

Hybrid zone patterns::Spatially explicit overlap zone; Patches vs boundary overlap; Alleles change within the hybrid zone; Ex: yellow and fire-bellied toads (near 100% of YB or FB at edges; as hybrids develop in the zone, problems occur and hybrid does not last long enough for specification)
^1674164454315

The environment and hybrid zones::Climate change shifts zones; Ex: S. and N. flying squirrel ranges never overlapped before, but a recent shift of Southern squirrels moving northward has caused ranges to naturally overlap now (may provide buffer to climate change if hybrid better suited to change - hybrid "vigor")
^1674164454319

When the sharing of genetics creates a hybrid that is better suited to the environment than the parent species, it is called ---::hybrid vigor; hybrid may outcompete parental species in that area
^1674164454322

What may occur w/ hybrids?::Hybrids could form due to a temporary reconnection; Reestablished gene flow is possible; Real-time speciation may be observed w/ hybrids today
^1674164454325

Reinforcement involves the strengthening of ---::reproductive barriers; Ex: European and collared fly-catcher females select male mates. W/ allopatric separation, males of both species appear similar (if mixing occurs again, confusion may occur); W/ sympatric separation, males are distinct (more reinforcement within sympatric)
^1674164454328

Natural selection is the agent of ---::change
^1674250492545

Fusion involves the weakening of ---::reproductive barriers; Gene pools become increasingly alike, speciation reverses, and biodiversity goes down; Ex: Bull trout is threatened western species while brook trout is introduced eastern species into the west (brooks outcompeting and hybridizing w/ bull; hybrid may further stress bull trout)
^1674164454335

Stability involves the continued formation of ---::hybrid individuals; Ex: YB and RB toads both routinely enter the hybrid zone and consistent hybrid zone forms (true regardless of low hybrid success); A narrow zone increases mating chances while a wider zone decreases hybrid numbers so the zone expands and shrinks (stability overall)
^1674164454338

The avg time for speciation is ---::6.5 my; Shortest = 4000 y and Longest = 40 my; Depends on persistence and cataclysm; Described in fossils and DNA
^1674164454341

Punctuated Model of Speciation::Short speciation period followed by prolonged stabilization; Abrupt extinction
^1674164454344

Gradual Model of Speciation::Small, incremental changes over the entire period; Produces two species over longer time than punctuated model
^1674164454347

^1674165719303

While best known for finch observations, Darwin also noted the profound similarities in ---::form and function between European hares and SA cavy as well as distinctly different tortoise species
^1674165719310

On his 5 year trip aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin described and extensively sampled the remarkably diverse organisms on a group of islands known collectively as ---::the Galapagos found off the western coast of South America.
^1674165719317

Darwin also observed many geological phenomena including unique ---::fossils that suggested Earth was much older than most scientists at the time believed.
^1674165719325

Darwin spent nearly 20 years samples to experts around the world, writing to other scientists, and analyzing his own notes before ---::finally publishing his landmark treatise in 1859.
^1674165719332

Alfred Wallace spent the majority of time developing ideas linked with the diversity of form and function of organisms in the ---::Malay Archipelago between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
^1674165719340

The basis of natural selection suggests organisms have ---::heritable variation, compete for finite resources, may vary in their repro success, and may adapt over generations when exposed to environmental change
^1674165719346

The genetic information that may lead to antibiotic resistance in bacteria is already found within ---::the genome and may randomly mutate in an individual under natural conditions.
^1674165719353

Darwinian fitness suggests that an individual's chance of spreading genes to subsequent generation is ---::relative among all individuals in the population; Different repro successes
^1674165719360

Example of an *analogous trait* that helps describe and provides support for evolution::Similar streamlined body form among tuna, mako shark, and bottlenose dolphin to move efficiently through the water.
^1674165719367

Example of *homologous traits* that help describe and provide support for evolution::Similarities w/ the four tooth types observed in the heterodont teeth of all land mammals; Similar anatomy of the forelimb observed in four-limbed vertebrates like birds, dinosaurs, amphibians, and mammals; Similarities in appearance associated with early embryonic development observed in fish, frogs, turtle, birds, and mammals.
^1674165719374

--- structures were likely important to the ancestral species but are viewed as evolutionary carryovers (non-functional) in derived species::Vestigial
^1674165719381

Which work (*On the Origin of Species, Principles of Geology, Essay on the Principle of Population, Scala naturae*) was published/described before all the others?::Scala naturae by Aristotle (OTOOS = Darwin, POG = Lyell, EOTPOP = Malthus)
^1674165719389

Evolution is supported by 100s of hypotheses and decades of ---::empirical data since the late 1800s
^1674165719396

Random genetic mutations and non-random selection of favorable traits form the ---::basis of evolution.
^1674165719403

Transitional fossils provide support of evolutionary relationships, but are not necessary to ---::infer relatedness in all animal groups.
^1674165719410

The Theory of Evolution does *not* directly relate to ---::the origin of life on Earth (genetics already in population for evolution to occur - decent w/ modification)
^1674165719417

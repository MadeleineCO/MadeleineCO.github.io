1. Diseases we select against
2. Cervical Vertebral Malfunction
	1. First discovered in Holsteins in 1999 in Danish, USA, UX, Netherland, and Japanese herds
	2. Affects the vertebrae 
	3. Pedigree records traced disorder to a single bull called Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell
	4. Genetic test is the surest diagnosis
	5. Caused by missense mutation in *bovine SLC35A3*
		1. Parents must both be hetero (monogenic *autosomal recessive* hereditary disorder)
3. Bovine Brachyspina Syndrome
	1. Pedigree info leads back to a bull named Sweet Haven Tradition in late 70s/80s
	2. Monogenic *autosomal recessive* hereditary disorder
	3. Main phenotype seen is shortening of spine
		1. Other issues include growth retardation, reduced body weight, uneven alignment of teeth, and malformation of internal organs 
	4. Caused by 3.3 kb deletion in the bovine Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group 1 (*FANCI*) gene on *chromosome 21*
		2. 3.3 kb = 3,300 long sequence is deleted
			1. A thousand base pairs = 1 kb
4. Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (BLAD)
	1. Pedigree traced disease back to Osborndale Ivanhoe
		1. Common bull in 50s and 60s
		2. Autosomal recessive
		3. Phenotype = recurring infection of soft tissues, fever, low appetite, chronic pneumonia and diarrhea, severe ulcers, ---
	2. Caused by a single point mutation (adenine -> guanine) at position 383 of the CD18 gene
		1. This caused an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at AA 128 (D128G) in the adhesion molecule to CD18
5. Syndactyly (Mule Foot)
	1. Reported in multiple breeds but traced back to a single Holstein ancestor
	2. Autosomal recessive w/ variable penetrance
		1. Not all animals w/ recessive genotype express this disease
		2. Can carry it but may not show it
	3. Phenotype = animals have fusion of two digits, causing the animal to only have one claw on at least one foot
		1. Front feet are most commonly affected
	4. Carriers are associated w/ superior milk and fat
		1. Creates a problem for selection
	5. Two independent mutations in the bovine LRP4 gene has been reported as the primary cause of syndactyly in Holsteins and Angus breeds 
6. Bovine Progressive Degenerative Myeloencephalopathy (Weaver)
	1. Found in Brown Swiss 
		1. Said to arise from inbreeding in the 1920s
	2. Autosomal Recessive
		1. Abnormal reflexes and hind leg function
		2. Gets worse over time
	4. Mapped to BTA 4: 46-56 Mb
		1. BTA = bos tauras autosome 
		2. Mb = a billion (---?)  base pairs 
	5. SNPs associated w/ genes expressed in nervous tissues
	6. NRCAM = neuronal cell adhesion molecule
	7. PNPLA8 = one non-synonymous change (serine -> asparagine)
		1. Synonymous change doesn't cause a change in the protein function
			1. Mutation doesn't lead to change in AA
	8. CTTNP2 = one synonymous and one non-synonymous (lysine -> glutamic acid)

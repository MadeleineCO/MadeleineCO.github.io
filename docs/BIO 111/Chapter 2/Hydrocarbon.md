I. Carbon can form a tetrahedral shape from C and H
	A. Four H atoms are equidistance from each other around C
II. Examples
	A. Methane (CH4)
		a. Tetrahedral
		b. Single bond
		c. One C and four H
		d. "ane" indicates single bond
	B. Ethane (C2H6)
		a. Tetrahedral
		b. Single bond
	C. Ethene (C2H4)
		a. Planer
		b. Double bond
			- "ene" indicates double bond
III. Structure
	A. Can be linear or cyclic (circular)
		a. Can form five and six membered rings
	B. Examples
		b. Cyclopentane
			- Circular
			- Single bonds
		c. Cyclohexane
			- Circular
			- Hexagonal
			- Single bonds
		d. Benzene
			- double bonds
		e. Pyridine
	C. Molecules with carbon can vary a lot
		a. Can form five and six membered rings
		b. Single or double bonds may connect the carbons in the ring
		c. Nitrogen may be substituted for carbon
	E. Molecules that have same num and type of atoms arranged differently are called **isomers** 
		a. Same side of double bond = *cis*
			- Opposite side of double bond = *trans*
		c. Structural isomers have different covalent arrangement of atoms
		d. Geometric isomers have a different arrangement of atoms around a double bond
		e. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other
	F. Can break up cells into four broad categories
		a. Lipid (fat)
			- Oleic acid and Iliadic acid have same nums of carbons, but different shapes
				i. Oleic acid has a bent shape
					~ cis configuration
				ii. Iliac acid has a linear shape
					~ trans configuration

1. Carbohydrates: Energy substrates (monosaccharides "one subunit", disaccharides "two subunits", polysaccharides "many subunits" like glucose polymers)
	1. Monosaccharide ex: glucose molecule (glucose is primary carb; most used)
	2. Polysaccharides generally take glucose and put them in chains 
		- Starch is series of glucose molecules and used for storage of energy in plants
		- Cellulose: Carbohydrate that is main component of the cell walls of most plants; used for physical structure of plants (like skeleton)
		- Glycogen: storage form of energy for animals
		- Chemical digestion can digest starch and glycogen, but NOT cellulose
		- Microbial digestion can digest starch, cellulose, and glycogen (creates usable side-products)
	3. [[Monogastric]] uses simple CHO's (glucose)
		- [[Pig (Porcine)]] can digest cellulose better than most monogastrics bc of functional cecum; Not nearly as well as [[Ruminant]]s and non ruminant herbivores but some
	4. [[Ruminant]]s and non-ruminant herbivores use simple CHO's (glucose) as well as volatile fatty acids 
		- VFA's; Primary source of energy (>80% in ruminants and >60% in non ruminant herbivores)
		- Acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid are main fatty acids and used to make ATP in a different way than simple carbs

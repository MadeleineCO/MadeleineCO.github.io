I. DNA and RNA
	A. A very large complex biomolecule ([[Macromolecules]])
	B. Structure is part of unique function
		- Involves two chains in antiparallel double helix
			a. In opposite directions
			b. Held by H bonds	([[Chemical Bonds]])
		- Width is 2 nanometers (nm)
		- Major groove
			a. [[Protein]]s interact with DNA
				i. Bind in the major groove
		- Minor groove
		- Made up of nucleotides 
			a. 5 nucleotides (4 in DNA) (3 of same in RNA and 1 different one)
			b. Nucleotide made up of three components
				i. Nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups
		- Has charged phosphate attached to carbon 5
		- Hydrogenous base
			a. Has N imbedded in double or single rings
				i. Double rings as group are called purines
					- GTCA make up DNA
					- GUCA make up RNA
				ii. Single rings are called pyrimidines
					~ Larger word = smaller structure
		- On Carbon 2, DNA has H (no oxygen) and RNA has hydroxyl group (OH)
			a. RNA breaks down quickly
				i. DNA does not
					~ Can extract DNA from ancient creatures
			b. DEOXY-ribose
				i. DNA has NO oxygen (deoxy)
				ii. vs. just ribose 
					~ RNA has oxygen in hydroxyl group
		- Hydrogenous base, ribose sugar, and phosphate
			a. Held together by H bonds
				i. Can be broken by changes in temp or pH
			b. Because they are antiparallel, there is front end (with phosphate group) and back end (three prime end w/ hydroxyl group)
				i. 5' end is front
				ii. 3' end is back
					~ Opposite to each other
		- A pairs with T, C pairs with G in DNA
			a. GC base pairs vs CT
				i. There are three H bonds vs two H bonds
					~ GC w/ three H bonds are harder to break than AT
					~ Times when DNA must come apart (copying), it's easier if they come apart in AT rich regions
			b. Backbone
				i. Very repetitive
					~ Sugar, phosphate, sugar, phosphate, etc.
				i. Backbone of [[Protein]] (NCC) repeats like backbone of nucleic acid (Sugar, phosphate) repeats
II. How do you read it?
	A. DNA is read in linear form
	B. TTCGAGCGACCTAACCTATAG. . .
		a. Left to right
III. Genes
	A. Contain info to make [[Protein]]s
	B. DNA Organized into discreet subsections called genes
		- Gene is genetic info used to make one protein
	C. Relationship between DNA and [[Protein]]s
		- When transforming, making temporary copy of instructions
			a. Creates temporary RNA
			b. Converts RNA into amino acids
			c. When you want to take DNA and convert in into RNA, you transcribe it
				i. Like speech to text
				ii. RNA version of DNA info
			d. Then, you translate RNA into language of [[Amino Acids]]
			e. [[Protein]]s have front end and back end, amino acid has front end and back end, RNA has front end and back end, DNA has front end and back end
				i. Relationship
				ii. The front end of a polypeptide chain is called end terminal
					~ Where there is available amino group
					~ Corresponds with 5' front end of nucleic acid
				iii. The back end of [[Protein]] corresponds with 3' back end of nucleic acid
IV. RNA
	A. Uses bases AGCU
	B. Single stranded vs double stranded in DNA
	C. Lifespan very short compared to DNA
	D. Three common forms
		- Ribosomal RNA - rRNA
			a. Two main parts
				i. Large subunit and small subunit
				ii. Makes up ribosome 
		- Messenger RNA - mRNA
			a. Temporary version of DNA info
			b. Must be converted
				i. Conversion occurs in ribosome
					~ Ribosome made up of rRNA
		- Transfer RNA - tRNA
			a. Converter/adapter
			b. One part complimentary to single stranded RNA
			c. Other part is an individual amino acid
		- All three come together at point you make protein
			a. Transcription is process of making mRNA from DNA
			b. Translation is process of making proteins from RNA template
			c. Reads mRNA in groups of three while tRNA begins to make polypeptide chain

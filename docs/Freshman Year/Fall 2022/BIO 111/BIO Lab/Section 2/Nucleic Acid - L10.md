1. Nucleic acid made up of nucleotides
	- Nucleotides are made up of *pentose sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogen base*
		1. Pentose sugar can be either deoxyribose or ribose
			- DNA (no oxygen) = deoxyribose
			- RNA (w/ hydroxyl group) = ribose
	- *Phosphodiester linkages* bind nucleotides to each other to make up nucleic acid
		1. Carbons labeled 1' - 5' in ribose sugar
		2. 1' bound to nitrogen base
		3. 3' bound to nucleotide
		4. 5' bound to phosphate
	- G links w/ C and A links w/ T in DNA
	- DNA has a directionality
		1. Read from 5' end and 3' end
2. DNA structure
	- Consists of two polynucleotide chains made up of nucleotides w/ phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, and nitrogenous base
		1. Sugar and phosphate make up backbone
		2. Phosphodiester bonds
		3. G to C w/ H bonds and A to T w/ H bonds
			- A-T has 2 H bonds while G-C has 3 H bonds so A-T separates more easily than G-C (important for DNA replication)
		4. 10 nucleotides every full turn of DNA
		5. Side rails of "ladder" made up of deoxyribose phosphate groups
		6. Steps of "ladder" made up of nitrogenous bases
3. How does DNA work?
	- Looks like long spiraling ladder 
	- Acts as "blueprint" or "recipe" for living things
	- Amino acids are monomers of proteins
		1. Proteins must be correct shape to function
		2. DNA instructs amino acids to form proteins
	- DNA inside nucleus while amino acids outside nucleus in cytoplasm
	- RNA
		1. Similar to DNA but single stranded and can leave nucleus
		2. Ribosomes = protein building machines
		3. DNA --> RNA --> ribosomes --> amino acids --> protein
		4. DNA codes for RNA and RNA codes for proteins
		5. Proteins form life
4. Sickle cell anima
	- Protein called hemoglobin
	- One nucleotide is wrong so hemoglobin protein is incorrect, leading to sickle-shaped blood cell
5. DNA replication
	- Original DNA used as template for new DNA strand
	- Helicase = unwinds DNA double helix
	- DNA polymerase III = works down leading strand and up lagging strand; synthesizes complementary bases
	- Semiconservative = new copies each contain new strand and original strand

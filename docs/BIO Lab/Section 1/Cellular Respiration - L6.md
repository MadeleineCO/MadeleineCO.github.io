1. All living organisms are made up of cells and all cells need energy
	- Process of getting energy
	- Energy management
	- Take high energy organic molecules and convert them into smaller energy packets
		1. Ex: glucose --> ATP
			- Like 100$ (high energy) --> 1$ (smaller, low energy packets)
	- Type of gas exchange
2. 1st stage (Glycolysis)
	- Glucose (C6H12O6) broken down into pyruvate
	- Produces net 2 ATP
	- Then goes to either aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration depending on availability of oxygen
3. Aerobic respiration
	- Occurs when oxygen (O2) is present
	- Much more energy-efficient
	- Occurs in mitochondria of eukaryotes
	- Krebs Cycle
	- Electron Transport System 
	- Creates total of 36 ATP
	- Glucose + Oxygen --> Water + CO2 + 36 ATP (energy)
4. Anaerobic respiration
	- Occurs in absence of oxygen
	- Much less energy-efficient
	- Produces Ethanol or Lactic Acid
	- Prokaryotes, Protists, Fungi, Protists
		1. Glucose --> Ethanol (2C2H5OH) + CO2 + 2ATP (energy)
		2. Fermentation
	- Animals
		1. Glucose --> Lactic acid (2C3H6O3) + 2ATP (energy)
		2. Lactic acid production
	- Creates total of 2 ATP
5. Our yeast experiment 
	- Feeding yeast (eukaryotic organism) glucose, maltose (instead of sucrose), and starch
		1. Also putting yeast in water as baseline
		2. Glucose is monosaccharide
		3. Maltose = two glucose molecules linked together (disaccharide) 
		4. Starch = polysaccharide made up of many glucose molecules
	- Testing at two different temperatures (0 and 37 degrees Centigrade)
		1. Investigating the effects of temp on anaerobic respiration
	- Measuring anaerobic respiration 
		1. Glucose --> Ethanol + 2CO2 + 2ATP
		2. Testing how it works w/ maltose, and starch as well as glucose
	- Think about the size of each of these substrates (glucose, maltose, starch)
	- Measuring how much CO2 was produced
		1. No CO2 produced = 10 ml
		2. CO2 produced is difference between 10 ml and measured amount of yeast solution after reaction
	- 4 replicants (4 tables worth of data)
		1. Will take averages

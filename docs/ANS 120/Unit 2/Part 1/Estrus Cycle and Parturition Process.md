1. [[Female Reproduction]]
	- [[Female Reproductive Structures]]
2. Sperm and ovum are both haploid 
	- Have half of chromosomes
	- Embryo is diploid and contains both sets of chromosomes
	- Ovum has zona pelluie (shell)
		- Sperm combines w/ ovum and creates embryo
3. Embryo
	- Starts dividing 
		- Cells get smaller as they divide 
	- Cells begin to specialize
	- The zona pelluiea still on outside surrounding inner cell mass
	- Tripoplast Cells within shell that become placenta
		- Eventually break out as placenta
4. Placenta = Fetal origin (out pocketing of the small intestine ([[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]]))
	1. Has several layers
		- Amnion (inner)
		- Chorion (middle)
		- Allantois (outer)
			- Watery fluid in the outside layer
			- Ruptures first (water breaking)
	2. Chorioallantois = fused layers of placenta (Chorion + Allantois) making up the outer sac
	3. Amnionic sac = makes up the inner sac
	5. Placenta attached to internal organism by ambilocal cord
	6. Uterine wall surrounds it all
	7. Functions
		- Exchange of products between the dam (mother) and offspring
			1. Nutrients an waste
			3. Oxygen and carbon dioxide
		- Hydraulic dampener
			1. Shock absorption 
			2. Ex: if mother is running, protects fetus from banging around
		- Parturition 
			1. Cervical dilation
				- Chorioallantois
				- 1st water sac expands (then ruptures/water breaking)
			2. Lubrication
				- Amnion fluid = lubricant in the birth canal
	8. Embryo
		- Called a fetus after the placental attaches to the uterine wall
		- A bird or reptile is always an embryo
		- In cattle, placental attachment takes time (from about 20-40 days)
	9. Types of attachment
		- Diffuse = attachment occurs via microvilli throughout the uterus
			1. Horse and pig
		- Zonary = regional diffuse attachment
			1. The attachment is diffuse, but only in a band or strip of the placenta to the uterus
			2. Dog and cat
		- Cotyledonary = attachment of placenta occurs only at specific sites located on the uterus wall
			1. Cattle, sheep, goats
		- Discoid = placenta attaches to the uterine wall by a single disc-shaped component
			1. Primates
		- Need enough layers that nutrients, waste, co2, and o2 go back and forth, but NOT blood components
			1. Prevents immune responses from attaching fetus
5. Parturition 
- See duration of stages table!
- Animals usually hide
	1. Avoiding predators 
- Stage I = Final prepatory 
	1. Uterine contractions 
	2. Cervical dilation
	3. Repositioning of fetus
		- Doesn't matter in small litter-baring species
		- Laying down and getting up helps to reposition
		- Feet should be turned down (?) to be head first
- Stage 2 = Delivery of fetus
	1. Must start when the 1st sac breaks
- Stage 3 = Removal of placenta
	1. In diffuse attachment, placenta comes out quickly
	2. Cotyledonary attachment takes longer
		- Fewer attachments, but stronger
- Afterward, cows lick to stimulate baby, then later baby walks, then it starts nursing all over the course of several hours
- Dystocia = some difficulty with the parturition process
	1. Pretty rare
	1. Possible causes
		- Birth weight to dam size issues
			1. Calf too big/dam too small
			2. If calf too big, you should pull down toward hox, not straight out
				- Grab bone, not joints
			3. The bigger the species, the more likely an issue may occur
				- More common in calves than sheep
		- Problems w/ conditions of the dam
			1. Extremes are problematic
				- Not sufficient nutrients or excess nutrients
					1. Not enough energy for parturition or excess fat in pelvic rim decreases diameter
			1. Too limited in condition
		- Malpresentation
			1. Least common 
				- <1% of dystocia in cattle
			2. Coming out the wrong way (ex legs first)
			3. Pigs don't need a specific orientation (very small compared to dam)

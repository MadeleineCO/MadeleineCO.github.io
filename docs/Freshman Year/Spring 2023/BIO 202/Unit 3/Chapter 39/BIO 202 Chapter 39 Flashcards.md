Gas exchange happens at a --- layer::capillary; Lined w/ ET
^1681241234538

Moisture is necessary for --- systems::respiratory; Epithelial cells must be surrounded by water (thin layer of water over surface); Water allows diffusion to occur
^1681241234550

Passive diffusion occurs across ---::membranes; O2 and CO2 diffuse from a high -> low concentration; ATP is *not* needed for passive diffusion
^1681241234558

Fick's Law of Diffusion::$R = \frac{DA\Delta p}{d}$  R = diffusion rate; D = diffusion coefficient (molecule-specific); d = diffusion distance; delta p = pressure difference; A = surface area
^1681241234566

What are the best ways to optimize R (diffusion rate)?::*Increase A* (surface area; ex gills, lungs); *Decrease d* (diffusion distance; 0.5 mm size limit); *Increase delta p* (concentration difference; constant water flow)
^1681241234573

Single-cellular organisms have direct diffusion across the cell's single ---::membrane; Bigger = too much volume for amount of SA (limits diffusion - must be small)
^1681241234580

Gills (fish)::Increase SA; Rich in capillaries; Blood movement goes in opposite direction of water movement (counter-current exchange - very efficient)
^1681241234588

Amphibians::Cutaneous respiration; Smooth, permeable skin (fair amount of blood lies underneath skin); Can have external gills
^1681241234595

Echinoderms use --- for gas exchange::microvilli
^1681241234601

Insects::Spiracle entryway can exchange air in multiple places; Branching tubes inside (tracheae network w/ pore-like openings)
^1681241234608

Crustaceans have internal ---::lungs; So do Mammals; Exchange occurs at alveoli level
^1681241234615

Gills are specialized tissues that ---::project into water for O2 exchange
^1681241234621

External Gills::Seen in some fishes and some amphibians; DA is especially vulnerable to direct damage (env exposure)
^1681241234628

Internal Gills::Branchial; Opercular (supportive bones); A so protected from the environment
^1681241234634

Both external and internal gills require ---::water to function
^1681241234641

Ram ventilation::Swim w/ mouth open; Forces water over gills; Constantly need to swim (movement of animal required to breath); Seen in some sharks
^1681241234648

Buccal Opercular Pump::Buccal & opercular interactions = buccal pumping; Buccal and opercular chambers change volume to ventilate gills; Water moves unidirectionally over the gills 
^1681241234656

When using a buccal-opercular pump, if mouth is open, the --- is closed::opercular; If mouth closed, opercular open
^1681241234663

Cutaneous Respiration::Mostly amphibians (some fishes, eels, and sea snakes); Highly vascularized skin w/ dense capillaries near surface of skin
^1681241234669

Cutaneous respiration provides more respiration than --- in amphibians::lungs; Some species have very weak lungs or no longs at all
^1681241234676

Importance of Cutaneous Respiration::Obligatory (animals without lungs obligated to use skin; ex hell binders, sea snakes) or Facultative
^1681241234684

1 atm = --- mmHg::760; Called *partial pressure*
^1681241234691

Atmospheric Air::78.09% nitrogen (600.6 mmHg), 20.95% oxygen (159.2 mmHg), 0.93% argon (0.2 mmHg), 0.03% carbon dioxide (negligible amount compared to N and O2)
^1681241234699

What about atmospheric air on highest mountains (0.5 atm)?::Increased elevation/altitude = reduction in air pressure; Concentration of gasses does not change, but half the amount 
^1681241234707

Tracheal System::Arthropods; Spiracles = openings that may open or close; Trachea and Tracheoles interact directly w/ tissues at a cellular level to provide gasses (extensive network)
^1681241234714

Gills were replaced by paired lungs bc ---::gravity and lack of support; Water loss through thin tissue
^1681241234721

Paired lungs minimizes ---::evaporation; Transports air internally via tubes; Saturate inspired air w/ moisture (thin fluid layer and membrane); Avoili expand as we breath in 
^1681241234728

Pneumonia::Too much fluid in the lungs; Can't fill avoili w/ air 
^1681241234735

Positive Pressure Breathing (Amphibians)::Low surface area; Inefficient; When nostrils open, buccal floor drops and air comes in; When nostrils close, buccal floor raises and air is forced into lungs 
^1681241234741

In some amphibians, positive pressure breathing w/ the lungs is augmented w/ ---::cutaneous respiration
^1681241234748

Negative Pressure Breathing (Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals)::Higher surface area; Involves thoracic cavity and muscle action; Volume = 1/pressure
^1681241234755

Volume and pressure relationship::V = 1/P; Inverse relationship; As V increases, P decreases and vise versa; Lungs create pressure difference by changing V
^1681241234762

Avian Lungs and Air Sacs::One-way movement (only fresh air; very efficient; High metabolic rate); Parabronchi and air sacs
^1681241234769

Parabronchi::Gas exchange center of birds; Uses two-breath cycle (must take two breaths to fully ventilate)
^1681241234775

Air sacs::Holds air (no exchange) in birds; Complete respiration; Dinosaurs also had these
^1681241234783

Exchange Structures::High surface area; Gas exchange center; Contains 300 million alveoli w/ about 80m^2 of SA; Very sensitive
^1681438577335

d = 0.5 - 1.5 um::Alveoli are about two cells thick (thin layer minimizes diffusion rate
^1681438577343

Exchange Structures Graphic::![[Pasted image 20230412111807.png]] Red = oxygenized blood; Blue = deoxygenized blood; Purple = gas exchange
^1681438577350

Inhalation Process::External intercostal and diaphragm *contact*; Negative pressure as thoracic volume increases and pressure decreases; Thorax and lungs -> Elastic tension
^1681438577358

Air passes into the lungs due to ---::pressure differential; Negative pressure as thoracic volume increases and pressure decreases 
^1681438577365

Exhalation Process::External intercoastal and diaphragm *relax*; Elastic tension is released as volume decreases and pressure increases
^1681438577373

Non-forced exhalation or forced exhalation can occur depending on ---::abdominal muscles (which can forcibly contract to produce greater exhalation)
^1681438577380

Tidal volume (Mammalian Ventilation)::500 mL (average at rest)
^1681438577387

Anatomical dead space (Mammalian Ventilation)::Trachea and bronchi; 150 mL

Breading rate is driven by ---::PCO2 (*not* O2); Hypoventilation = Increase in PCO2; Hyperventilation = Decrease in PCO2
^1681438577400

The respiratory control center (RCC) of the bran can cause a ---::negative feedback loop (ex holding breath)
^1681438577407

When you hold your breath, blood PCO2 and H2CO3 ---::increases (PO2 and pH decreases); Chemoreceptors stimulated by these changes (sends impulse to RCC, which sends impulse to EI and diaphragm); Involuntary inhalation occurs
^1681438577414

Binding Affinity (BA)::Refers to the ability to hold O2; P50 = 50% saturation of pigments
^1681438634463

There are two distinct curves for P50 (50% saturation of pigments). One for --- and one for ---::hemoglobin; myoglobin
^1681438634473

[[2023-04-14]]
Factors affecting Binding Affinity (BA)::Pigment type; Temp; pH; CO2; Loading vs Unloading
^1681505698282

At areas where we want O2 to be unloaded, we change ---::conditions so that BA goes down 
^1681505698290

When we want to increase the pH, the amount of O2 able to be held ---::increases
^1681505698296

High temps result in less ---::O2 capacity
^1681505698303

Hemoglobin (Hgl)::Red blood cells; 4 heme groups; 4 Fe atoms; Oxy- (has O2) vs Deoxy- (no O2)
^1681505698309

Once you bind one O2, Hgl changes ---::conformation and encourages the second to bind; As second and third bind, affinity increases more until the fourth is bound
^1681505698314

Myoglobin::Muscle cells; One Fe atom; High binding affinity; Especially important for marine mammals
^1681505698320

Whales collapse their lungs so that ---::it can sink (affects buoyancy); Can do this for about two hours
^1681505698325

A disparity is needed between fluids so that gas exchange can ---::passively; *Partial pressure difference* promotes passive diffusion of gasses
^1681505698333

Venous Blood::PO2 = 40 mmHg; PCO2 = 46 mmHG
^1681505698340

Alveolar gas::PO2 = 105 mmHg (promotes movement of O2 from alveoli to blood (105 vs 40)); 40 mmHg (promotes movement of CO2 from blood into alveoli (46 vs 40)); 1 atm (160 mmHg at sea level)
^1681505698346

1 atm is equal to ---::160 mmHg at sea level; 0.5 atm = 80 mmHg; 0.25 = 40 mmHg; High altitudes affect the diffusing of gasses between blood and lungs
^1681505698351

Arterial Blood::PO2 = 100 mmHg; PCO2 = 40 mmHg
^1681505698357

Transport of CO2 (Graphic)::![[Pasted image 20230414165150.png]]

^1681505698368

Carbonic anhydrase (CA)::Converts CO2 -> H2CO3; Removes CO2 from the plasma
^1681505698375

The buffering system can favor release of ---::CO2 out of lungs
^1681505698380

Transport of CO2 (Percentages)::10% of CO2 is dissolved, 30% is protein-bound (Hgl), and 60% is chemically modified (bicarbonate ion)
^1681505698386

[[2023-04-18]]
Upper Respiratory Infection::Affects nose, sinuses, pharynx, or larynx; Ex: Flu, cold, epstein-bar, pertussis (whooping cough), strep throat, sinusitis (fills sinuses w/ fluid), laryngitis,  and tonsillitis

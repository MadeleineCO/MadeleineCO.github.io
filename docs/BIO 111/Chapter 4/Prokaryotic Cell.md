I. [[Cellular Structures]]
	A. Prokaryotic [[Cell|cells]] do not a membrane-bound nucleus
	B.. DNA not defined by a membrane ([[Nucleic Acid]])
		- Membranes made up of phospholipid ([[Protein]])
		- Genetic material is present in nucleoid
			a. DNA is not considered in one area so collectively called nucleoid DNA
				i. Function same as nucleus DNA
	C. No well defined organelles
II. Shapes/structures
	A. Spherical (Cocci), rod (Bacillus), spiral (Spirilla)
		- Classify prokaryotic cells based on shapes
	B. Can be in groups or alone
III. Two types of prokaryotes
	A. Archaea
		- Unusual environments
			a. Have [[Protein|proteins]] that are heat tolerant
				i. Can resist high temps bc of unusual characteristics
	B. Bacteria
		- Ex: E.coli
			a. If e-coli comes from lower digestive track to upper digestive track, you get sick
		- Common characteristics
			a. Have ribosomes ([[Cellular Structures]], [[Nucleic Acid]])
			b. Plasma membrane is the boundary made up of phospholipids ([[Protein]])
			c. Cell wall made up of [[Carbohydrate]]
			d. Method of locomotion
				i. Ex: Flagella
			e. Cytoplasm
				i. Like water inside water balloon
					~ A cell can only have so much volume before breaking; Size is limited
						~ Surface (plasma membrane) area to volume (cytoplasm) relationship
						~ Volume increases at 10x the rate of the surface area
						~ Relative sizes of [[Cell|cells]]
							~ The biggest single cell on the planet is an ostrich egg (shell allows it to hold)
							~ On a logarithmic scale (10 fold increase in of volume to surface area)
						~ This is why cells must be small

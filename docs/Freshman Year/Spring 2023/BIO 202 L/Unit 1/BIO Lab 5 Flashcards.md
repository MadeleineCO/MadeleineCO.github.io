Binomial nomenclature::Genus + Species to refer to creatures; DKPCOFGS
^1675900454858

An animal must --- their food::ingest; Heterotrophic
^1675900454869

Phylum Porifera::Consists of *sponges*; Aquatic organisms; The simplest of animals; Filter feeders
^1675900454877

Characteristics of Phylum Porifera (sponges)::Asymmetrical; Crude radial symmetry; No definitive tissues; Exhibit cell specialization level of organization using different cell types (no true specialized tissues however); Spongin (structure support)
^1675900454885

Phylum Cnidaria::Called cnidarians; Aquatic organisms; Ex: Jellyfish, Sea Anemone; 2nd simplest (after sponges (porifera)) 
^1675900454893

Characteristics of Phylum Cnidaria::Radial symmetry; Diploblasts (ecto + endo); Two major body morphs (polyp and medusa); Only one opening (GVC; mouth and anus the same); Asexual (budding) and sexual 
^1675900454899

Cnidarians can transition between two major ---::body morphs, poly and medusa; Poly is stationary (ex hydra, sea anemones, coral spend majority of life in this stage); Medusa is mobile (ex jellyfish spend majority of life in this stage); Some transition between stages while others stay in one form their whole lives
^1675900454906

In Cnidarians, the epidermis is derived from the ---::ectoderm; Gastrodermis is derived from the endoderm; Diploblasts
^1675900454913

Phylum Platyhelminthes::Platy = "flat" and helminthes = "worm"; Flatworms; Some are free-living in freshwater and others are parasitic (ex tapeworms, flukes); Called Planarians; 3rd simplest (after cnidarians)
^1675900454920

Characteristics of Phylum Platyhelminthes::Acoelomates (no coelom); Bilateral symmetry; Triploblasts; Display cephalization (more pronounced head and nervous system w/ brain and excretory system); Incomplete gut; Muscles provide body support; Sexual and asexual
^1675900454926

Phylum Rotifera::Called Rotifers; Aquatic freshwater animal; Filter feeder; 4th simplest phylum (after platyhelminthes)
^1675900454933

Characteristics of Phylum Rotifera::Pseudocoelomates; Bilateral symmetry; Both a head and a complete gut; Tissues derived from all three primary germ layers to make up organ system (Triploblasts); Full nervous system and excretory system; Hydrostatic body support; Sexual and asexual
^1675900454940

Phylum Nematoda::Called roundworms; 5th simplest phylum (after rotifera); Parasitic
^1675900454946

Characteristics of Phylum Nematoda::Sexual dimorphism (male = smaller and hooked end; female = longer/larger, genital pore); Complete digestive system w/ mouth and anus; Pseudocoelomates; Bilateral symmetry; Organ systems derived from all three germ layers; Nervous system + brain; Hydrostatic body support; Sexual repro
^1675900454954

P. Parazoa Review::No organs, tissues, muscles, or nerves; Filter feeders; Hermaphroditic; Sexual and asexual repro, Osculum, collar cells (choanocytes), Spicules (structural); Sponges
^1675901072250

Eumetazoa Branch Radiata::Radial symmetry, Diploblastic; Body morphs (poly, medusa); Only one body opening; Carnivorous; Nematocysts; Simple muscles and nerves; Phylum Cnideria (hydra, jellyfish, coral, sea anemone)
^1675901072256

Eumetazoa Branch Bilateria::Bilateral symmetry; Cephalization (head + nervous system); Triploblastic
^1675901072261

Protostomes::Blastopore forms mouth; Spiral and determinate cleavage; Coelom formed by splitting of mesoderm
^1675901072266

Protostome Subbranch Acoelomates::No true body cavity; Only one body opening; Phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms) -> Class Turbellaria (planaria), Class Trematoda (flukes), Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
^1675901072273

Protostome Subbranch Pseudocoelomates::Body cavity not lined w/ mesoderm; Two body openings; Phylum Rotifera (rotifers) and Phylum Nematoda (true body cavity lined w/ mesoderm; 2 body openings; either protostomes or deuterostomes)
^1675901072279

Deuterostomes::Blastopore forms anus; Radial and indeterminate cleavage; Coelom formed by outpocketing of archenteron; Phylum Echinodermata (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, sea lilies, sea urchins, sea daisies); Phylum Chordata (notochord, dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, postanal tail)

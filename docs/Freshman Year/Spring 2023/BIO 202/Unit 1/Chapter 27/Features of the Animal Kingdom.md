1. Features of Animals
	1. Ophisthokonta
		1. Supergroup
		2. Shared characteristic = single flagellum
			1. Ex: sperm cell, fungi spores 
		3. Shared by Choanoflagellates, Fungi, and Animals
	2. Heterotrophs
		3. All animals must acquire energy from another source via eating
			1. Plants = autotrophs
		4. Herbivores = plant eaters 
		5. Carnivores = meat eaters
		6. Omnivores = meat and plant eaters
		7. Detritivores = eat by breaking things down
			1. Decomposers 
			2. Ex: maggots, fungi
	3. Multicellular
		1. Many types of cells each w/ specific functions within one organism
		2. Functional individual composed of multiple cell types
		3. Sponge = simplest multicellular animal 
		4. Cells can communicate with each over
			1. Creates tissues
	4. Animal cells lack cell walls
		1. Absence by definition
			1. Plants do have cell walls
		2. Can have extracellular matrix (protein + glucose units) and cytoskeleton to hold cells together
			1. Uses a protein network
	5. Most actively move
		1. Walk/run, swim, and fly
		2. Convergent evolution
			1. Wings for flight
				1. Ex: birds, insects, pterosaurs 
			2. Streamlined body shape for swimming, flight, etc
		3. Some are sessile (sedentary)
			1. Ex: sponges sea anemones
	6. Diversity of Form
		1. Invertebrates
			1. Majority
		2. Vertebrates
			1. More derived
	7. Diversity of habitat
		1. Marine
			1. Most life started in sea then transitioned to freshwater then to land
		2. Freshwater
		3. Terrestrial 
	8. Asexual reproduction
		1. Binary fission
			1. Mostly seen in prokaryotes, not animals
		2. Budding
			1. Seen in Cnidarians
		3. Parthenogenesis
			1. "virgin beginning"
				1. One of few exceptions to needing a sperm and egg
				2. Females can reproduce females via just the ovum
			2. Insects and a few vertebrates
	9. Sexual reproduction
		1. Primary form of reproduction in animals
		2. Meiosis produces the gametes (n)
		3. Male (sperm) + female (ova)
		4. Gametes fuse to form zygote (2n)
			1. Ancestral tends to be more external and derived tends to be more internal 
	10. Embryonic deveolpment
		1. Cleavege = series of mitotic divisions
			1. As zygote undergoes cleavage, smaller cells are created and there is no cell growth
				1. Somatic cells do undergo cell growth (mitosis ends up with cells of similar sizes)
				2. Cleavage only seen in germ cells
		2. Multiple Stages
		3. Gastrulation
			1. Formation of Archenteron (primitive gut)
				1. Becomes digestive system eventually
			2. Embryonic germ layers
				1. Eventually develops into true tissues
	11. Tissues and more
		1. Tissues = collections of cells which preform specialized tasks
		2. Embryonic germ layers (ecto-, meso-, or endoderm)
			1. Endoderm is more derived state
	12. Larval Formation
		1. Distinct life stages that are different from the adult
		2. Short-lived
			1. Transient form
		3. Ex: freshwater mussels 
			1. Larva are squirted onto a fish head, latch on to gills, then act as parasites 
		4. Ex: sea urchins
	13. Metamorphosis
		1. Seen in insects 
		3. Incomplete
			1. Stages look similar 
				1. Like smaller versions of the adult
			2. Ex: grasshopper
				1. Various stages like the nymph stage
		4. Complete
			1. Distinct stages
				1. Stages don't compete w/ each other
				2. Last stage is the reproductive stage
			2. Ex: Caterpillar to pupae to butterflies 
			3. Extodices = molting 
2. Evolution of the Animal Body Plan
	1. Six key traits to classify animals
		1. Symmetry (radial/bilateral)
		2. Tissues and Body Organization
		3. Body cavity (coelom)
		4. Embryonic development
		5. Segmentation (repeated body units)
		6. Digestive tract (extra- to intracellular digestion)
	2. Brief Overview of Animal Phylogeny
		1. See phylogenic tree on slideshow
	3. Body Symmetry
		1. Radial 
			1. Cnidarians/ctenophores
				1. Ex: sea anemone 
			2. Can divide like a pie around the central axis 
				1. Each slice is similar
			3. Movement is rarely directional 
		2. Bilateral
			1. Most other animals 
			2. Anterior/Posterior
			3. Ventral/Dorsal
			4. Cephalization (nervous)
				1. Distinct head
				2. Vestibular system in head, eating, eyes, etc.
				3. Push for a brain
			5. Planes of symmetry
				1. Sagittal plane divides us in half vertically
				2. Traverse plane divides us in half horizontally
				3. Coronal (Frontal) divides us in half from the side
			6. Directional terms
				1. Dorsal = towards the back
				2. Ventral = towards the belly
				3. Cranial (Anterior) = head
					1. Use cranial in bipedal organism
				4. Caudal (Posterior)
					1. Like tail area 
					2. Feet in humans
				5. Medial = down the middle
					1. Lateral
					2. Left side and right side
				6. Proximal = closer to the center of mass
					1. Proximal is near chest area
					2. Distal = closer to fingers
				8. Reference point is important
		3. Tissues and Body Organization
			1. Embryonic tissues
				1. Mono-
				2. Diplo
				3. Triploblastic
				4. Endoderm = internal layer
				5. Mesoderm = middle layer
				6. Ectoderm = external layer
			2. Body organization 
				1. Hierarchy
					1. Cell -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ system -> Organism
				2. Major tissues that each have specific tasks
				3. ---
			3. Coelom = "body cavity"
				1. From the mesoderm
				2. Between the gut and the body wall
				3. Peritoneum other CTs
				4. Support and cover organs
				5. Ex: cranial cavity, dorsal cavity, thoracic cavity, spinal cavity, abdominal cavity, pelvic cavity, ventral cavity, abdominopelvic cavity
			4. Classifications
				1. Acoelomate
					1. "A" = absence
					2. Absence of coelom
				2. Pseudocoelomate 
					1. Have fluid filled cavity
					2. False coelom 
				3. Eucoelomate
					1. True coelomates 
					2. Ex: humans
			5. Novel Innovation of Tissues
				1. Zygote develops into different cells (determinant)
					1. Each cell is determined and stays that way
						1. Once a muscle cell, always a muscle cell
					2. Stem cells are before determination 
				2. Form together into unique tissues
				3. Porifera = nondeterminate
					1. Seen in plants
					2. Not seen in animals
			6. Embryonic Development
				1. Role of *Hox* genes
					1. AKA Homeotic genes
					2. Each gene -> segment development
					3. Determines the number of body segments and the number/placement of appendages
					4. More genes = increased development specializations
						1. More specialized tissues and functions 
				2. Blastopore development
					1. If it forms into mouth, organism is a protostome
					2. If it forms into anus, organism is deuterostome
						1. We are deuterostome
				3. Cleavage patterns
					1. Spiral (misaligned poles)
						1. A protostome trait
					2. Radial (aligned poles)
						1. A deuterostome trait
						2. More derived trait
			7. Segmentation
				1. Redundant systems
					1. Damage to one is not fatal
					2. Others can duplicate function
				2. Improved locomotion
					1. Individual segments move semi-independent
				3. May fuse, embryonic growth is segmented
					1. Ex: arthropods
				4. Vertebrae and muscle (vertebrates)
					2. Evidence of segmentation in humans
		4. Digestive Tracts or Systems
			1. Gastrovascular Cavity (GVC or sac)
				1. Incomplete digestive system w/ one opening
				2. Digestion and nutrient transport
					1. Both gastro and vascular
				3. Fairly rudimentary
			2. Complete digestive system (tubular)
				1. Alimentary canal (tube within a tube w/ two openings)
				2. In congress w/ cardiovascular system (transport)
					1. Pump nutrients around body
				3. More specialized and efficient than GVC

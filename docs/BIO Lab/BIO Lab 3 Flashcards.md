Cell Theory::Every organism is made up of at least one cell; Cell is the basic unit of life; Produced by division of pre-existing cells
^1662573182884

Prokaryotic Cells::Lack membrane-bound organelle; Relatively simple interior structure; Region of DNA (nucleoid) instead of nucleus DNA; Small ribosomes
^1662573182895

Prokaryotic cells reproduce by --- and are ---::fission;1-10 microns in diameter (A micron is 1 millionth of a meter)
^1662573182902

Types of prokaryotic organisms::bacteria, archaea, cyanobacteria
^1662573182908

Bacteria shapes::Coccus (round/spherical), Bacillus (rod-shaped), Spirillum (corkscrew/spiral)
^1662573182914

Archaea (biol)::Found in extreme environments; thermophiles (very hot) and halophiles (very salty)
^1662573196113

Cyanobacteria::blue-green algae; Oscillatoria and Anabaena; Can photosynthesize; provide oxygen
^1662573182922

Eukaryotic Cells::Cytomembrane (endomembrane) system and membrane bound organelles; Relatively complex interior structure; DNA in nucleus and chromatin (individual chromosomes); Large ribosomes
^1662573182928

Eukaryotic cells reproduce by --- and are ---::mitosis and meiosis; larger than prokaryotic cells (10-1000 microns in diameter)
^1662573182934

Types of eukaryotic cells::Protists, Fungi, Plants, Animals
^1662573182939

Protists::Single celled organisms; Ex: Paramecium, Amoeba, Euglena, Volvox, Physarum, Slime mold
^1662573182945

Fungi example::yeast
^1662573182951

Plants have cell walls made up of ---::cellulose; ex: elodea
^1662573183113

Animal example::human cheek cells

1. Gas exchange happens at a capillary layer 
	1. Lined with ET 
2. Moisture is necessary for respiratory systems
	1. Epithelial cells must be surrounded by water
	2. Thin layer of water over the surface
	3. Water allows diffusion to occur
3. Passive diffusion
	1. Occurs across membranes
	2. O2 and CO2 diffuse from a high -> low concentration	
	3. ATP is *not* needed for passive diffusion 
	4. Fick's Law of Diffusion$$R = \frac{DA\Delta p}{d}$$
		2. R = diffusion rate
		3. D = diffusion coefficient (molecule-specific)
		4. d = diffusion distance
		5. delta p = pressure difference
		6. A = surface area
		7. What are the best ways to optimize R?
			1. Increase surface area (A)
				1. Gills and lungs
			2. Decrease diffusion distance (d)
				1. 0.5 mm limit (thickest possible)
			3. Increase concentration difference (delta p)
				1. Constant water flow
4. Gas Exchange Systems
	1. Single-cellular organisms
		1. Direct diffusion across the cell's single membrane
		2. Bigger = too much volume for amount of SA (limits diffusion)
			1. Must be small
	2. Fish
		1. Gills
			1. Increases SA
		2. Rich in capillaries
		3. Blood movement goes in opposite direction of water movement (counter-current exchange)
			1. Very efficient
	3. Amphibians
		1. Cutaneous respiration
		2. Smooth, permeable skin 
			1. Fair amount of blood lies underneath skin
		3. Can have external gills
	4. Echinoderms
		1. Microvilli for gas exchange
		2. ---
	5. Insects
		1. Spiracle entryway
			1. Can exchange air in multiple places
		2. Branching tubes inside
			1. Tracheae network with pore-like openings 
	6. Crustaceans have internal lungs
	7. Mammals
		1. Lungs (internal)
		2. Exchange occurs at alveoli level 
5. Gills
	1. Specialized tissue projecting into water for O2 exchange
	2. External
		1. Some fishes
		2. Some amphibians
		3. DA so vulnerable to direct damage
			1. Env exposure
	3. Internal
		1. Branchial 
		2. Opercular
		3. A so protected from the env
	4. Both require water to function
	5. Ram ventilation
		1. Swim w/ mouth open
		2. Forces water over gills
		3. Constantly need to swim
			1. Movement of animal required to breath
		4. Seen in some sharks
	6. Buccal-Opercular Pump
		1. Buccal & opercular interactions = buccal pumping
			1. Moth and opercular chambers 
			2. Change volume to ventilate gills 
				1. If mouth open, opercular closed
				2. If mouth closed, opercular open
			3. Water moves unidirectionally over the gills 
		2. Buccal fills
		3. ---
6. Cutaneous Respiration
	1. Mostly amphibians
		1. Some fishes, eels, and sea snakes 
	2. Highly vascularized skin
		1. Dense capillaries near the surface of the skin
		2. Provides more than lungs (some species have very weak lungs)
			1. Some are purely reliant on cutaneous respiration (no lungs at all)
	3. Importance
		1. Obligatory
			1. Animals without any lungs are obligated to use their skin
			2. Ex: hell binders, sea snakes 
		2. Facultative

7. Atmospheric Air is O2 Rich
	1. 1 atm = 760 mmHG (called *partial pressure*)
	2. Atmospheric air is 78.09% nitrogen (600.6 mmHg), 20.95% oxygen (159.2 mmHg), 0.93% argon (0.2 mmHg), 0.03% carbon dioxide (negligible amount compared to N and O2)
	3. What about highest mountains (0.5 atm?)
		1. Increased elevation/altitude = reduction in air pressure
			1. Concentration of gasses does not change, but half the amount 
8. Tracheal System
	1. Arthropods
	2. Spiracles
		1. Openings that may open or close
	3. Trachea
		1. ---
	4. Tracheoles
		1. Interact directly w/ tissues at a cellular level to provide gasses
		2. Extensive network
9. Paired Lungs
	1. Gills were replaced bc. . .
		1. Gravity and lack of support
		2. Water loss through thin tissue
	2. Minimizes evaporation
		1. Transport air internally via tubes
		2. Saturate inspired air w/ moisture
		3. Thin fluid layer and membrane
		4. Avoili expand as we breath in 
			1. ---
		5. Pneumonia = too much fluid
			1. Can't fill avoili w/ air 
10. Positive Pressure Breathing
	1. Amphibians 
	2. Low surface area
	3. Inefficient
	4. Gas exchange process
		1. Nostrils open
			1. Buccal cavity
			2. Drop buccal floor
			3. Air comes in
		2. Nostrils close
			1. Raise buccal floor
			2. Force air into lings
	5. Augment w/ cutaneous respiration
11. Negative Pressure Breathing
	1. Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals
	2. Higher surface area
	3. Involves thoracic cavity and muscle action
	4. Volume = 1/pressure
		1. As V increases, pressure decreases and vise versa
		2. Inverse relationship
		3. Lungs create pressure difference by changing volume
12. Avan Lungs and Air Sacs
	1. One-way movement
		1. Only fresh air
		2. Very efficient
		3. High metabolic rate
	2. Parabronchi
		1. Gas exchange center
		2. Two-breath cycle
			1. Must take two breaths to fully ventilate
	3. Air sacs
		1. Hold air (no exchange)
		2. Complete respiration
		3. Dinosaurs also had these

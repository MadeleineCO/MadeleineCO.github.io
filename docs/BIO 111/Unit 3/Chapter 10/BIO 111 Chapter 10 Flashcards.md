Sea urchin begins life as ---::single cell that divides to form two cells. After four rounds of cell division, there are 16 cells. After many more rounds, the individual develops into a complex, multicellular organism as seen in a mature sea urchin. (Different cells are different sizes, determined by signals; Common processes across organisms for reproduction)

Prokaryote vs Eukaryote genomes::Nucleus (E) vs. Nucleoid (P); Linear (E) vs. Circular chromosems (P)
^1665028840319


Sometimes bacteria can accumulate new functions they ---::didn't originally have; Can exchange plasmids; Basis for antibiotic resistance
^1665028840326


Bacteria (bio)::Cell wall outside of membrane; Flagellum for locomotion; Circular chromosomal DNA localized in nucleoid; Plasmid
^1665028840333


Plasmid::Circular; To replicate DNA, must separate strands in the origin of replication (two H bonds between ATs but three H bonds between GCs, so origin of replication has more ATs to split more easily)
^1665028840340


After splitting the strands in the origin of replication, enzyme (DNA polymerase) ---::reads a single strand and matches to complimentary base, working in one direction (from 5' front (w/ phosphate) to 3' back (w/ hydroxyl))
^1665028840347

Because the 5' front and 3' back run in different directions, the point where DNA polymerases reading the strands meet is called the ---::point of termination
^1665028840354

After DNA has been split and copied by DNA polymerase, a cleavage furrow ---::pinches the cell into two cells; Requires proteins that help separate and create a permanent boundary (called septum) between the cells
^1665028840361

Binary fission stage 1::Cell begins to elongate and FtsZ proteins migrate toward the midpoint of cell
^1665028840368


Binary fission stage 2::Duplicated chromosomes separate and move away towards opposite ends of cell; FtsZ proteins form ring around periphery of midpoint between chromosomes 
^1665028840374


Binary fission stage 3::FtsZ ring directs formation of septum that divides the cell; Plasma membrane and cell wall materials accumulate in middle divider 
^1665028840381


Binary fission stage 4::After septum complete, cell pinches in two, forming two daughter cells; FtsZ disperses throughout the cytoplasm of the new cells
^1665028840388

Heterochromatin is --- and Euchromatin is ---::non expressed DNA; expressed DNA
^1665199365481

Nucleosome::Complex of DNA wrapped around histone proteins; Appearance of beads on a string; Promotes and guides coiling of DNA (Histones pos charged and DNA phosphate groups neg charged so strongly attracted)
^1665199365486

Nucleosomes are wrapped into --::higher order coils called solenoids; Leads to fiber 30 nm in diameter; Usual state of nondividing (interphase) chromatin
^1665199365491

During mitosis, chromatin in solenoid arranged around scaffold of protein to achieve ---::maximum compaction; Radial looping aided by condensin proteins
^1665199365496

Organization of Eukaryotic Chromosomes::DNA double helix --> DNA wrapped around histone --> Nucleosomes coiled into a chromatin fiber; Further condensation of chromatin; Duplicated chromosome
^1665199365500

Telomeres::Ends of chromosome
^1665199365505

Centromere::Region of constriction around the middle or off to one side called centromere; Short arm = P arm; Long arm = Q arm
^1665199365510

Particular genes are located on particular chromosomes then a specific location P arm or Q arm; Like an address; Mapped so you can know where a particular gene

Chromosomes occupy certain regions of the nucleus when ---::not highly condensed; When cell struts to divide, they become tightly packed and see them in microscopes
^1665199365515

Gene (bio2)::A region of a chromosome w/ specific genetic info; Dispersed throughout chromosomes and in non-dividing nucleus but

Heterochromatin::If tightly packed in nondividing nucleus; Transcriptionally silent; Not expressed and transcriptionally silent
^1665199365520

Euchromatin::When DNA is expressed in a non dividing nucleus; Chromosomes spread out
^1665274319647

There are 4 major parts to ---::cell reproduction; first three (G1, S, G2) are part of interphase; Mitosis (M) after interphase; Cytokinesis (C) occurs in some cells after M
^1665274319655

Cells spend most of their life in ---::interphase (G1, S, or G2); Very short time spent in M phase when division of nucleus to make two cells occurs
^1665274319662

The time it takes to complete a cell cycle ---::varies greatly; Fruit flies have an 8 min cell cycle (more quickly than binary fission (20 min) bc eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication and can start at multiple points); Mature cells take longer to grow (typically 24 hrs)
^1665274319668

If a cell doesn't divide, it spends its life in ---::G0; ex neurons
^1665274319675

Most cells spend time in ---::resting phase (G0) whereas growth accurs during G1, S, and G2 phases (interphase)
^1665274319681

Cell cycle consists of ---; During interphase, cell grows and nuclear [[DNA]] is ---. Interphase followed by miotic phase in which ---::interphase and miotic phase; duplicated; duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Cytoplasm divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells
^1665274319687

Mitosis consists of ---::prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase
^1665274319692

Prophase (First)::when chromosomes condense and become visible; Spindle fibers emerge from centrosomes; Nuclear envelope (membrane) breaks down; Nucleolus disappears
^1665274319696

Prometaphase (Second)::Chromosomes further condense; Miotic spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores; Centrosomes move toward opposite poles; Kinetochores appear at centrosomes
^1665274319700

Metaphase (Third)::Miotic spindle is fully developed and centrosomes are at opposite poles of cell; Chromosomes lined up at metaphase plate; Each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle fiber originating from opposite poles
^1665274319703

Anaphase (Fourth)::Cohesion proteins binding to sister chromatids together break down; Sister chromatids (now called chromosomes) are pulled towards opposite poles (Pulled apart at centromere; w/ arms trailing behind); Non-kinetochore spindle fibers lengthen, elongating the cell
^1665274319707

Telophase (Fifth)::Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense; Nuclear envelope material surrounds each set of chromosomes; The spindle breaks down
^1665274319710

Cytokinesis::After mitosis in animal cells; Ring of actin filaments from the metaphase plate; Ring contracts, forming a cleavage furrow so cell divides in two
^1665274319714

Plant cell division after mitosis::Forms cell plate from secretions of cellulose; Created in middle of dividing cell
^1665274319717

Interphase consists of ---::G1 (cells undergo major growth), S (DNA replication), and G2 phases (Chromosomes coil tightly using motor proteins; centrioles replicate; tubulin synthesis)
^1665274319721

Centromere (bio)::Point on constriction on chromosomes; Kinetochore is attachment site for microtubules; Each sisters chromatid has a centromere; Chromatids stay attached at centromere by cohesion (Replaced by cohesion in metazoans)
^1665274342470

Prior to replication, chromosome composed of ---; After replication, chromosome composed of ---::single DNA molecule; 2 identical DNA molecules (held together by cohesion proteins); Visible as 2 strands held together as chromosome becomes more condensed (1 chromosome = 2 sister chromatids)
^1665274319724

Mitotic spindle microtubes; Like railways (gently curving but mostly straight); Kinetochores bind to a motor protein, walks on microtubules to transport sister chromatid

Control of the cell cycle::Two irreversible points (Replication of genetic material and Separation of sister chromatids); Checkpoints that check for accuracy and can be halted if errors (Allows cell to respond to internal and external signals)
^1665274319728

The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the --- Proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the --- Attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at the ---::G1 checkpoint; G2 checkpoint;  M checkpoint:
^1665274319742

The concentrations of cyclin proteins change throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct correlation between ---::cyclin accumulation and the three major cell cycle checkpoints. Sharp decline of cyclin levels following each checkpoint (the transition between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin is degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes.
^1665274319746

Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other proteins that advance the ---::cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a CDK must bind to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.
^1665274319749

Cancer::Uncontrolled cell growth: Failure of cell cycle control; Doesn't make right proteins, receptors, etc as tissues not working correctly; Checkpoints don't work so damaged DNA is not corrected
^1665274319753

[[2022-10-14]]
G1/S Checkpoint::Cell "decides" to divide (temporarily doubles chromosomes so that there are 48 pairs); Primary point for external signal influence; Checks if there are all the necessary resources (ex energy, monomers); If good, moves past checkpoint to S phase
^1665772987056

G2/M Checkpoint::Cell makes a commitment to mitosis; Assesses success of DNA replication from S phase; If DNA damaged, goes back to be fixed
^1665772987063

Late Metaphase (spindle) checkpoint::Cell ensures that all chromosomes are attached to the spindle; At this point, chromosomes visible, tightly packed, and lined up; Must make sure they are properly hitched and will be pulling in the right direction
^1665772987069

A series of proteins called cyclins allow ---::control of the checkpoints in the cell cycle; Different cyclin concentrations rise and fall at different times
^1665772809316

Ubiquinone::Can be put on a cyclin to mark it for degradation; After cyclins are ubiquinoned, concentration levels drop as they are destroyed 
^1665772809325

CDKs are protein kinases that can phosphorylate ---::cyclins (activates them so levels elevate to advance cell past a checkpoint); To be fully activated, CDK must bind a cyclin and be phosphorylated by another kinase
^1665772809412

Cyclin and CDK interaction::CDK binds to cyclen; A kinase then phosphorylates the cyclin/CDK; Then the activated cyclin/DIX phosphorylates a target protein; The activated protein advances the cell cycle; Cyclin is ubiquinoned and destroyed
^1665772809419

Cancer cells don't preform their normal functions while ---::using up the body's resources as they grow uncontrollably; Like a parasite
^1665772809425

Two kinds of genes can disturb the ---::cell cycle when they are mutated; Tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes
^1665772809431

Proto-oncogenes::Like car accelerator (activates gene expression); Cancer genes are oncogenes (normal cellular genes that became oncogenes when mutated); Many encode receptors for growth factors and signal transduction proteins
^1665772809437

Carcinogens::Chemicals that mutate DNA, resulting in cancer
^1665772809443

Growth factors can be found on ---::cell surface or intracellular; Many are on the cell surface, and if these are mutated to always be "on," cell no longer depends on growth factors; Carcinogens can mimic natural ligands or growth factor can be mutated so that it no longer needs a signal (leadin to cancer)
^1665772809449

Only one copy of a --- needs to undergo mutation causing growth factors to always be "on" (resulting in uncontrolled division and cancer)::proto-oncogene
^1665772809455

Tumor-Suppressor Genes::Like car brakes (normally block gene expression and have a backup "emergency" brake); p53 plays critical role in G1 checkpoint by monitoring integrity of DNA (Normally if DNA damaged, either replaced or apoptosis); Usually prevents development of mutated cells
^1665772809462

p53 (tumor-suppressor gene) is absent or damaged in many ---::cancerous cells; Both copies of tumor suppressor gene must lose function for cancerous phenotype to develop; Mutated p53 does not arrest the cell cycle so damaged cell continues to divide
^1665772809468

First tumor suppressor identified was the ---::retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb); Predisposes individuals for a rare form of cancer that affects the retina of the eye; Inheriting a single mutant copy of Rb means that the individual only has one "good" copy left
^1665772809474

The Rb protein integrates signals from ---::growth factors and role to bind important regulatory proteins and prevent stimulation of cyclin or CDK production
^1665772809481

When a transcription factor binds to DNA, it changes the general structure. Double helix is 2 nm in width. When protein binds, it bends it. That can start ---::transcription of that region or inhibit it.
^1665772809487

Unphosphorylated Rb binds to transcription factor E2F. E2F cannot bind the ---::DNA and transcription is locked. Cell growth triggers the phosphorylation of Rb, which then releases E2F, which binds the DNA and turns on gene expression. This advances the cell cycle. (Rb halts the cell cycle and releases its hold in response to cell growth)
^1665772809493

The role of normal p53 is to ---::monitor DNA and the supply of oxygen (prevents hypoxia); A cell with an abnormal p53 protein cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal apoptosis (then becomes cancerous)
^1665772809500

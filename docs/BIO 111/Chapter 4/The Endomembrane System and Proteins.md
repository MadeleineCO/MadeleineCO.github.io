1. Ribosomes on endoplasmic reticulum on nucleus
	1. Ribosomes in can be transported in part of endoplasmic reticulum w/ vesicles through Golgi apparatus (also membrane) then can fuse with plasma membrane and now is [[protein]] in plasma membrane
		- How you get membrane-bound [[protein]] out to plasma membrane
		- Series of membranes throughout the cytoplasm
		- Can be rough (w/ ribosomes) or smooth (without ribosomes)
		- Secretions 
			- Can secrete proteins out of [[cell|cells]]
			- Can secrete carbs and fats
			- Mammals secrete milk (lactation is secretion)
			- Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
		2. Golgi apparatus: has vesicles and folded membranes within cytoplasm
			- Helps w/ secretion and intracellular transport
			- Processes and packages proteins and lipid molecules, especially proteins destined to be exported from the cell

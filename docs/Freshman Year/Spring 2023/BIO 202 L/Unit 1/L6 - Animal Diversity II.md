1. Coelom = body cavity
	1. Only seen in triploblasts 
		1. Bilateral symmetry 
	2. Derived from the mesoderm
		1. Between the ectoderm and the endoderm
	3. ![[23-16.gif]]
	4. In roundworms, reproductive structures lay in the pseudocoelom
	5. True coelomates = eucoelomates
		1. Complete digestive system
		2. Coelom is completely lined by the mesoderm
		3. Can be protostomes or deuterostomes (phylum mollusca, annelida, and arthropoda all are protostomes)
2. Phylum Mollusca (mollusks)
	1. Protostomes
	2. Eucoelomates
	3. Body arrangement includes head, unique body plan, complete gut
	4. Most are marine
	7. Nervous system w/ brain and excretory system utilizing nephridia
	8. Open circulatory system
	9. Respiratory system using gills or lungs
	10. Shells or floats for body support
	11. Monoecious or dioecious sexual repro
	12. Exterior body plan involves a head, mantle, and foot
		1. Foot for mobility
		2. Radula = rasping tongue to eat
		3. Mantle creates shell
	13. Bivalves (clams, mussels, scallops, and oysters)
	14. Gastropods (snails, slugs, nudibranchs, and conch)
	15. Cephalopods (squid, octopus, and chambered nautilus)
3. Phylum Annelida (segmented worms)
	1. Bilateral symmetry
	2. Protostomes
	3. Hermaphroditic 
	4. Head, segmented body, and complete gut
		1. First appearance of body segmentation so far
	5. Coelom is lined by peritoneum within each segment
	6. No respiratory system ("breaths" through skin)
	7. Clitellum = aids in reproduction
		1. Anterior end is closest to the clitellum
	8. Dorsal side is darker than the ventral side
	9. Closed circulatory system
	10. Sexual and asexual reproduction
	11. Larval stages
	12. Septum = clear transverse piece of tissue
		1. Like a wall by segments 
	13. Hydrostatic body support
	14. Ex: earthworm
4. Phylum Arthropoda
	1. Bilateral symmetry
	2. Thee body regions - head, thorax, and abdomen
	3. Segmentation
	4. Organ systems including nervous, excretory, open circulatory system
	6. Breath through skin
	7. Body is supported by chitin exoskeleton
	8. Sexual repro, larvae, metamorphosis, and some parthenogenesis
	9. Ex: cricket, crayfish

1. [[The Genetic Material]]
	- Mutagens = [[DNA]] can be damaged by chemical or physical agents called mutagens
	- Mistakes during [[DNA replication]] can lead to changes in the DNA sequence and other [[DNA]] damage (*mutations*)
	- [[DNA replication]] all occurs during S phase of cell cycle (during interphase)
		1. Checkpoints are meant to access DNA
		2. Repair mechanisms may be able to correct issues
	- Issues can occur in [[Prokaryotic Cell|prokaryotes]] or [[Eukaryotic Cell|eukaryotes]]
	- Specific [[DNA]] repair = targets a particular type of DNA damage
		1. Ex: photorepair of *thymine dimers*
		2. Thymine dimers form in response to UV [[light]]. Changes basic diameter of DNA (no longer 2 nm; physical deformity)
			- *Photolyase* can identify thymine dimers and break covalent bond to restore DNA's normal 2 nm width
			- Dimers that are not fixed cannot be read by [[DNA]] polymerase (copy error)
			- Sunburns --> skin [[cancer]]
	- Mismatch repair = incorrect base is detected after replication 
		1. Mismatch repair [[enzymes]] detach and remove the base from the newly synthesized strand
		2. The gap is filled w/ the correct base by [[DNA]] pol II
		3. Unmethylated [[Nucleic Acid|nucleotides]] are newly synthesized whereas original nucleotides are methylated
	- Non-specific [[DNA]] repair = can repair many different kinds of damage
		1. Can repair many different kinds of damage
		2. Ex: excision repair ---
2. Types of mutations
	- Point mutations = base substitutions (substitute one base for another)
		1. Transitions or transversions
		2. ---
	- Silent mutations have no effect on [[protein]] sequence (like synonyms)
	- Missense = results in amino acid substitution
	- Nonsense = substitutes a stop codon for an amino acid
	- Frameshift mutations = insertions or deletions of nucleotides may result in shift in reading frame or insertion of stop codon
		1. Nucleotides read in groups of 3
		2. Insertion or deletion may change groups 
	- Chromosomal mutations = changes in structure of chromosome
		1. Deletions  = ---
		3. Duplication = ---
		4. Inversion = ---

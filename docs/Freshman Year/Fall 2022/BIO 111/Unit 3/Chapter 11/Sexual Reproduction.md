1. Sexual Life Cycle
	- Made up of [[Meiosis]] and fertilization
	- Diploid [[Cell|cells]]
		1. Somatic cells of adults have 2 sets of chromosomes ([[DNA]])
		2. Mitosis results in diploid cells ([[Cell Reproduction]])
	- Haploid cells
		1. [[Meiosis]] results in haploid cells (gametes)
		2. Gametes have only 1 set of chromosomes 
			- 23 chromosomes total
			- Eggs or sperm
		3. Offspring inherit genetic material from 2 parents
			- 2 haploid sets = 1 diploid set
			- Egg (23) + sperm (23) = zygote (46)
			- Allows you to have characteristics from both parents
	- Life cycles of sexually reproducing organisms involves the alternation of haploid and diploid stages
		1. Some life cycles include longer diploid phases while some include longer haploid phases
			- In most animals, diploid state dominates
			- Some animals reproduce very rapidly (ex insects)
			- Human gestation = 9 months
			- Elephants gestation = 18 months
			- Birds lay eggs
				1. Incubation times can differ
				2. Typically hatch on multiples of seven (21 days, 28 days, etc.)
			- Desert plant that only reproduces once every 100 years 
				1. Called century plant
	 - Zygote first undergoes mitosis to produce diploid cells
		 1. Later in the life cycle, some of these diploid cells undergo [[Meiosis]] to produce haploid gametes
2. [[Meiosis]]
3. Haploid, Diploid, or Alternate life cycle
	- In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the gametes gives rise to a fertilized egg [[Cell]], or zygote. The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular offspring. The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote. 
		1. Diploid-dominant life cycles
	- Fungi, such as black bread mold (Rhizopus nigricans), have haploid-dominant life cycles. The haploid multicellular stage produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes [[Meiosis]] to produce haploid spores. Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid [[Organism]] by mitosis. 
		1. Fungi spend most of their time in as haploid 
			- Haploid-dominant life cycles
	- Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a multicellular haploid [[Organism]] and a multicellular diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living. The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by [[Meiosis]]. The spores develop into multicellular, haploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte.
		1. Amount of time spend as diploid and haploid is more equal
4. Possible Errors
	- Nondisjunction = failure of chromosomes to move to opposite poles during either meiotic division
		1. Supposed to go to opposite poles but end up going to same pole instead
		2. Gametes are supposed to each have one set for one set + a backup set in a zygote
	- Aneuploid gametes = gametes with missing or extra chromosomes
		1. A [[Cell]] with less than the normal number is aneuploid
		2. A cell w/ too many sets is polyploidy
		3. Most common cause of spontaneous abortion in humans
		4. 1-22 chromosomes are autosomes and the 23rd pair are sex chromosomes. If you  have a nondisjunction event of bigger chromosomes, info is in the wrong amounts
	- Trisomy 21 or Down Syndrome
		1. An extra copy of chromosome 21
		2. Have different physical features and can have mental effects

1. Long bones
	1. Length is greater than width
	2. Diaphysis (shaft)
	3. Epiphyses (ends)
	4. Ex: Humerus & Femur
2. Short bones
	1. Cuboidal
	2. Length = width
	3. Ex: Carpels & Tarsals
3. Flat bones
	1. Thin and broad
	2. Important for organ protection
	3. Ex: Sternum & Ribs
4. Irregular bones
	1. Complex shapes
	2. Ex: Vertebrae & Hip
5. Sesamoid bones
	1. Small & flat
	2. Ex: Patellae
6. Sutural bones
	1. Small, Flat, and irregular
	2. Ex: skull
7. Bone Tissue
	1. Bones = organs
		1. Collections of tissue
		2. Blood, CT, Nerves, and BT
	2. Compact Bone
		1. Cortical bone
		2. Hard external surface of all bones
		3. Surrounds medullary cavity
		4. Important for protection and strength
	3. Spongy Bone
		1. Cancellous bone
		2. Inner layer
		3. No osteons (bone cells)
		4. Trabeculae and bone marrow
			1. Trabeculae = ---
			2. Bone marrow forms blood cells
				1. Certain hormones signal creation of more blood cells
8. Bone Cells and Function
	1. Mesenchyme
		1. Loosely organized cells
		2. Found in embryonic mesoderm
		3. Mesenchyme cells 
		4. Undifferentiated stem cells
			1. Can become connective or skeletal tissues
	2. Osteoblasts 
		1. Cells that secrete the matrix for bone formation
		2. Alkaline phosphatase -> Ca3(PO4)2 -> Hydroxyapatite
		3. Hydroxyapatite adds hardness and collagen adds flexibility
	3. Osteoclasts
		1. Multinucleate cells
		2. Derived from white blood cells 
			1. Not part of musculoskeletal system
			2. Part of immune system
		3. Breakdown bone matrix
		4. Activated by PTH
			1. Parathyroid hormone signals that we don't have enough calcium
			2. See graphic
				1. Opposing hormones to do different things
				2. Homeostasis
	4. Osteocytes 
		1. Trapped osteoblasts
		2. Become living bone cells
	5. Lacunae
		1. Tight spaces that house osteoblasts
	6. Canaliculi
		1. Canals that connect lacunae so that osteocytes can communicate
	7. Haversian canal
		1. Central canal
		2. Contains blood vessels for osteon 
9. Important Terms Review
	1. See graphic
10. Ossification
	1. Osteogenesis
	2. Bone formation
		1. Not calcification (generally refers to wherever calcium is deposited)
	3. Intramembranous
		1. Fibrous membranes
		2. Start w/ mesenchymal cells and end w/ flat bones (for skull and mandible)
	4. Endochondral
		1. Most bones are endochondral formation 
		2. Hyaline cartilage
		3. Start w/ chondrocytes and end w/ all bones but mandible
11. Bone Growth
	1. Growth Plate (GP)
		1. Epiphyseal plate
		2. As ossification occurs, more and more bones stop growing
			1. Still living tissue but growth stops
		3. Based on age (forensics)
			1. Can age younger children based on presence or absence of growth plates
		4. Growth hormone disorder
			1. Treated w/ injections
				1. Routine injections
				2. May involve breaking bones to help them grow
			2. Ex: Lionel Messi
				1. Short
				2. Did not have proper growth of bones
	2. Bone Remodeling
		1. Remodeling after repeated stress (thickens in response)
			1. Prevents fractures
			2. Cannot rebreak a bone in the same spot (more robust)
		2. Chronic low calcium deficiency (osteoporosis)
			1. Bone Ca decreases
			2. Risk of fractures increases
			3. More women then men are deficient
12. Structural Joints
	1. Fibrous 
		1. W/ fibrous CT
		2. No cavity or space
			1. No movement
		3. Ex: sutures of skill
	2. Syndesmoses
		1. Bands of CT
		2. No cavity or space
			1. Some but very little movement
			2. If movement, amount is associated w/ length of CT
		3. Ex: tibia and fibula (ankle)
		4. Ex; gomphoses and teeth
	3. Cartilaginous 
		1. Synchondroses
			1. Hyaline cartilage
			2. Epiphyseal plate
				1. Growth plate
		2. Symphyses
			1. Hyaline cartilage cats as covering
			2. Fibrocartilage connects the vertebrae
		3. Both Synchondroses and Symphyses have No cavity or space
			1. Very little movement
				1. If any movement, inflammation could occur 
	4. Synovial 
		1. Space between bones
		2. Synovial cavity and fluid lubricates joints
			1. As close to a frictionless surface as possible in nature
			2. Ex: shoulder movement is very smooth
		3. Ends are covered w/ hyaline
		4. Articular cartilage
		5. Joints that move are generally less stable than bones that cannot move
13. Functional Joints
	1. Types
		1. Synarthrosis (immovable)
		2. Amphiarthroses (slight movement)
		3. Diarthroses (free movement)
	2. Movement types 
		1. Gliding 
		2. Angular 
		3. Rotational
		4. Special
			1. Ex: jaw
	3. Synovial Joints in Detail
		1. Pivot (atlas-axis)
			2.  Moving head "yes" and "no"
		2. Hinge (elbow)
			1. One is sliding within the other
		3. Saddle (carp-metacarp)
			1. Wrist move in many different ways
			2. Carpel tunnel
				1. Inflammation of nerves in tunnel that goes to wrist
		4. Plane (ankle)
		5. Condyloid (rad-carp)
		6. Ball-and-socket (hip and shoulder)
			1. Can be aggravated by repetitive motion

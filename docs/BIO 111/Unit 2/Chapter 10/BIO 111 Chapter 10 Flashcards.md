Sea urchin begins life as ---::single cell that divides to form two cells. After four rounds of cell division, there are 16 cells. After many more rounds, the individual develops into a complex, multicellular organism as seen in a mature sea urchin. (Different cells are different sizes, determined by signals; Common processes across organisms for reproduction)

Prokaryote vs Eukaryote genomes::Nucleus (E) vs. Nucleoid (P); Linear (E) vs. Circular chromosems (P)
^1665028587697

Sometimes bacteria can accumulate new functions they ---::didn't originally have; Can exchange plasmids; Basis for antibiotic resistance
^1665028587706

Bacteria (bio)::Cell wall outside of membrane; Flagellum for locomotion; Circular chromosomal DNA localized in nucleoid; Plasmid
^1665028616325

Plasmid::Circular; To replicate DNA, must separate strands in the origin of replication (two H bonds between ATs but three H bonds between GCs, so origin of replication has more ATs to split more easily)
^1665028587715

After splitting the strands in the origin of replication, enzyme (DNA polymerase) reads a single strand and matches to complimentary base, working in one direction (from 5' front (w/ phosphate) to 3' back (w/ hydroxyl))

Because the 5' front and 3' back run in different directions, the point where DNA polymerases reading the strands meet is called the point of termination

After DNA has been split and copied by DNA polymerase, a cleavage furrow pinches the cell into two cells; Requires proteins that help separate and create a permanent boundary (called septum) between the cells

Binary fission stage 1::Cell begins to elongate and FtsZ proteins migrate toward the midpoint of cell
^1665028587723

Binary fission stage 2::Duplicated chromosomes separate and move away towards opposite ends of cell; FtsZ proteins form ring around periphery of midpoint between chromosomes 
^1665028587729

Binary fission stage 3::FtsZ ring directs formation of septum that divides the cell; Plasma membrane and cell wall materials accumulate in middle divider 
^1665028587736

Binary fission stage 4::After septum complete, cell pinches in two, forming two daughter cells; FtsZ disperses throughout the cytoplasm of the new cells
^1665028587744

Karyotype::Particular array of chromosomes in an individual organism; Arranged according to size, staining properties, location of centromere, etc.
^1665028587751

Humans are ---::diploid (2n); 2 complete sets of chromosomes; 46 total chromosomes
^1665028587758

Haploid (n)::1 set of chromosomes; 23 in humans
^1665028587766

Pair of chromosomes are ---::homologous; Each one is a homologue

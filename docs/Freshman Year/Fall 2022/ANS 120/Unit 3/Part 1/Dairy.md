1. [[Milk]] provides nutrients for offspring
	- We milk goats, cows, sheep, llamas, horses, mice (research), etc.
	- All mammals 
	- 90% of all fluid milk comes from [[Cattle (Bovine)|cattle]]
		1. Overall, consumption of dairy products is increasing
			- Efficiency has gone up as well (num of cows has decrease, but production has increased)
			- More efficient use of land, [[Nutrition - Water|water]], feed, etc.
			- Fewer farms but more cows per farm
		2. California and Wisconsin are greatest producers. Idaho and Texas follow-ups
			- 1,500 cows in CA producing much more than 11,000 cows in WI
			- Very different management systems
			- Bigger farms = more efficient
			- South is in milk deficit area; West is milk surplus.
				1. Cows eat a lot less in summer
					- Microbes make them hotter
				2. More diseases in the South
2. Products
	- Fluid [[Milk]] (45%)
		1. Homogenized
			- Whole milk
			- 3.5% fat
		2. Low fat
			- 1-2%
		3. Skim
			- 0.5%
		4. Half and Half
			- 12-15%
		5. Whipping Cream
			- 20-30%
		6. We have ways to extract the fat to add to creams and create lower fat milks
	- [[Milk]] consumption continues to go down
		1. Overall consumption of milk products is going up
		2. Fermented/Frozen Products
			- [[Cheese]]
			- Butter
				1. Start w/ [[Milk]] then separate into fat and raw skim milk
				2. Blends fat into pasteurized cream
				3. Ripened cream is aged 
				4. Thickens then churned
				5. Overall US does not consume much butter, but consumption going up
				6. 70-80 % fat
			- Yogurts
				1. Bacteria + milk
				2. Yogurt consumption sorta leveled off (kinda increasing)
			- Ice milk (low fat ice cream products) and ice cream
				1. 3-7% fat
				2. Turns crunchy and crystalized after a while
				3. Low fat compared to typical ice cream (most 12-15% fat; Some up to 30%)
				4. We eat more ice cream than most of world
			- [[Milk]] is a little heavier than [[Nutrition - Water|water]]
				1. 8.6 lbs./gallon
					- Water is 8.3
				2. Butter is heavy, then ice cream, then [[Cheese]], then cottage [[Cheese]], then yogurt
					- More fat = heavier
		3. Milk fat by species
			- Human - 3.7%
			- [[Cattle (Bovine)]] - 4.0%
			- [[Horse (Equine)]] - 1.3%
			- [[Pig (Porcine)]] - 5.3%
			- [[Cat (Feline)]] - 3.3%
			- [[Dog (Canine)]] - 8.3%
			- [[Sheep (Ovine)]] - 5.4%
			- [[Goat (Caprine)]] - 4.4%
			- Elephants - 15.8%
			- Sea lions - 30-40%
				1. Would taste very fishy
				2. Compounds that can be absorbed in milk influence flavor
				3. Big and cold environment so need more energy
			- Correlated to energy requirements
				1. Fat is very high in energy
				2. Good for newborns
3. [[Cattle (Bovine)]]]
4. [[Lactation]]
7. Milking Process
	 - Entry into parlor or barn
		 1. Stress-free environment they are used to
	- Pre Dipping
		1. Sanitize the teat 
	- Fore-Stripping
		1. Check for abnormal [[Milk]] such as flakes, clots, or watery appearance
	- Drying
	- Attach unit
		1. Adjust so that it hangs squarely beneath the udder
	- Detach Unit
	- Post dipping
		1. Decreases chance of infection from bacterial entry into mammary gland via Furstenberg's Rosette
	- Milking parlors designed to optimize speed of the process
		1. Different styles of getting cow in and out
		2. Takes same amount of time to milk cow, but getting cows in more quickly if more efficient 
		3. Automated machines are hard bc cows not always uniform
8. Increase in efficiency due to genetic selection ([[Genetics]])
	- Genetic selection = selecting the parents of the next generation
	- Producing much more [[Milk]] than the cows would normally need
	- Extensive use of artificial insemination has made the biggest difference in dairy industry
			1. Excellent records of performance
	- Heritability = Proportion of a trait passed from parent to offspring
			1. Most dairy genes are moderately heritable, meaning that we have a chance at predicting trait expression
	- 90% of selection is based of the sire
		1. We look at daughter's production to identify good sires
		2. Then can freeze semen and ship around world for AI
		3. Sire summaries = Prediction of a daughter's potential performance based off genetic estimates
		 4. If 1805 lbs. listed, then we expect daughters to produce 1805 more lbs. of milk *per [[Lactation]]* compared to the avg of the breed
			- Heterosis = greater trait expression compared to the avg of the breed
		5. If 71% fat listed, then we expect the daughters to produce 71% more pounds of fat per lactation compared to the avg of breed
		6. What info do you need to know to determine the actual effect on your herd?
			- You must know the average of the breed for that trait and your herd average for that trait.
			- Ex: Breed avg = 20,000 lbs. per [[Lactation]]. Your herd avg = 25,000 lbs. per lactation
				- The daughters of this sire are expected to produce 1,805 more lbs. of [[Milk]] per lactation compared to the avg of the breed.
				- Getting this breed of cow would lower your production even if the daughters of the sire are expected to produce 1,805 more lbs. than the avg of the breed. 1,805 more wouldn't make up the difference.
				- Breed averages change so must always check
9. In the dairy industry, would you prefer more heifers or more sires?
	- You would want more heifers bc we have so much AI
	- Genetic selection ([[Genetics and Mating]])
		1. Sexing semen
			- A sperm has either an X or a Y chromosome. If X sperm combines w/ ovum (all have X chromosomes), then you get a heifer calf. If Y sperm combines w/ ovum, then you get bull calf.
			- 60-80% successful at controlling the sex of the offspring 
			- How can you tell difference between X sperm and Y sperm?
				1. X sperm should have more volume in head (bigger head)
				2. Y sperm has slightly smaller head
				3. The Y sperms are faster bc they are smaller
					- In theory, the Y sperms can swim faster than the X sperm
				4. X sperm has more DNA so tends to be more negative than Y sperm (less DNA = less negative)
					- You can sort based on electric charge
						1. Set up two plates (on pos and one neg) then let sperm fall and they should sort themselves be repelling or attraction
			- Can kill a lot of sperm in the process (big downside)
10. bST (bovine Somatotropin)
	- Used to be called bGH (growth hormone)
		1. 1st letter indicates species ([[Cattle (Bovine)|bovine]])
	- Somatotrophin = stimulating cells
		1. Major regulator of [[Milk]] production
		2. Naturally occurring hormone that has big impact on production
	- 2005 - 17.2% of cows receive bST
		1. Effects include 6-8% increase in feed intake and 10-20% [[Milk]] production
		2. Then you can get rid of more cows
			- Smaller but more efficient herd
	- Increases metabolic rate
		1. Increases lipolysis (fat breakdown)
		2. Makes more nutrients available
		3. In pigs, animals get leaner bc they can use more fat
	- No detectable difference in [[Milk]] composition
		1. May not be great for the cow but not harmful to people
			- Pushes animals beyond what may be ideal for animals
		2. Social pressure drove bST away (by 2017, not used)
	- No influence on mastitis 
11. Ultimate Success of Dairy Industry
	- Dairy Herd Improvement Association 
		1. Record system
		2. Keeps averages of breeds
	- Limited number of traits selected 
		1. Many are positively related (one goes up w/ another)
	- Adaption of technology
		1. AI ([[Genetics and Mating]])
		2. Environmental control to optimize environment to maximize production

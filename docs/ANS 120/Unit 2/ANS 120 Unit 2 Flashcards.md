Importance of reproductive rates::Just a 3% improvement in reproductive rate would greatly increase num of animals and consequently production
^1663253862998

Sometimes we want to ---- reproduction and sometimes want to --- reproduction of a species::increase (ex endangered species); limit (ex feral cats)
^1663253863007

Estrous Cycle::All physiological and behavioral changes from one ovulation to the next consecutive ovulation (Different from menstrual cycle in humans/primates)
^1663253863014

Estrus::Period of receptivity to be bred by the male
^1663253863020

[[2022-09-17]]
Ovum::Female gamete
^1663447019455

Follicle::Involves the ovum and all the cells that support ovum development in an ovary
^1663447019468

Ovulation::Release of the ovum from the follicle; The follicle ruptures and the ovum is released away from the ovary
^1663447019475

Gestation::The process of prenatal development of an organism *in the uterus*
^1663447019481

Parturition::The birth process
^1663447019488

Oviposition::The process of laying an egg (usually avians)
^1663447019495

Incubation::Embryonic development outside the body (usually avians)
^1663447019501

Ewe (sheep) reproductive info::17d Estrous cycle; 30hr Estrus; Time of ovulation is near end of estrus; 147d Gestation; 1-3 Offspring
^1663447019514

Mare (horse) reproductive info::21d Estrous cycle; 5-7d Estrus; Time of ovulation is 24h before end of estrus; 336d Gestation; 1 Offspring
^1663447019520

Sow (swine) reproductive info::21d Estrous cycle; 44hr Estrus; Time of ovulation is near end of estrus; 114d Gestation; 6-14 Offspring
^1663447019527

Bitch (dog) reproductive info::6-7mo Estrous cycle; 4-14d Estrus; Time of ovulation is near end of estrus; 65d Gestation; 4-8 Offspring
^1663447019533

Queen (cat) reproductive info::18d Estrous cycle; 9-10hr Estrus; Time of ovulation is induced; 52d Gestation; 4-8 Offspring
^1663447019540

Doe (rabbit) reproductive info::19d Estrous cycle; Constant Estrus; Time of ovulation is induced; 31d Gestation; 4-8 Offspring
^1663447019546

Human reproductive info::Menstrual Estrous cycle; No Estrus; Time of ovulation is midcycle; 270d Gestation; 1 Offspring
^1663447019553

Chicken reproductive info::No Estrous cycle; No Estrus; Time of ovulation is 6am-2pm; No Gestation; Clutch 5-10 Offspring
^1663447019560

Duplex::Marsupials and rodents; Two cervices
^1663447019567

Bicornuate::Livestock, dogs, cats; Poorly to moderately developed uterine horns in mares and cows but highly developed in bitches, queens, and sows; Two ovaries, two oviducts, a single cervix, two uterine horns, a uterine body, a vagina
^1663447019573

Simplex::Humans, primates; No uterine horns
^1663447019580

Ovary::Exocrine function (ovum production and ovulation); Endocrine function (hormone production)
^1663447019587

After a follicle grows and and animal goes into estrus ---- occurs::exocrine (production and release of ovum)
^1663447019594

Hormones::Chemical signals that are designed to travel through circulatory system for communication (controlled by nervous system (faster) or endocrine system (slower))
^1663447019601

Estrogen (E2)::"Hormone of Estrus" (Involved w/ physiological and behavior changes that prepare for sperm transport and fertilization); From follicle cells
^1663447019607

Testosterone (T)::Required for ovum development; From follicle cells
^1663447019614

Corpus Luteum::"Yellow body"; Develops from cells of follicle after ovulation; Produces Progesterone (P4)
^1663447019621

Progesterone (P4)::"Hormone of pregnancy" (Prepares reproductive track for gestation); From corpus luteum
^1663447019628

 Estrous cycle ex::If a cow's cycle is 210 days, first the follicle grows and produces estrogen until it peaks and ovulation occurs (which breaks the follicle). Then, the corpus luteum grows and produces P4. If animal not pregnant, the corpus luteum and P4 goes away, follicle starts regrowing, and cycle restarts.
^1663447019635

"Follicle wars"::Cows have multiple follicles, but only one ends up ovulation
^1663447019642

Oviduct::Between ovaries and uterotubial junction; Also called fallopian tubes; Important for transport of both the ovum and sperm; Site of fertilization; Also provides nutrition fluid for embryo while in transport to uterus
^1663447019649

Fertilization occurs in the ---::infundibulum (top of oviduct funnel from ovaries)
^1663447019656

1. [[Early Ideas on Heredity]]
2. Principle of Segregation
	- Alleles separate (segregate) during gamete formation ([[meiosis]]).
		1. If an individual is homozygous, all of its gametes will have the same form of the allele.
		2. If an individual is heterozygous, half of its gametes will have the dominant allele and half the recessive allele.
		3. Alleles are joined at random during fertilization to produce the genotypes of the offspring.Â  One allele from father, one allele from mother.
		4. Creates genetic diversity and different combinations of alleles 
	- 2 ways of increasing genetic diversity
		1. Crossing over (prophase I)
		2. Random assortment (metaphase I)
	- Chromosomes are measured in units called centimorgans
		1. Thomas Morgan studied fruit flies
		2. >7200 centimorgans in humans
			- Companies target certain centimorgans (such as 23 In Me)
			- Golden state killer and genetic forensics
3. Punnett Squares
	- Can be used to predict offspring genotypes
		1. Determine genotypes of gametes produced by each parent
		2. Ex: XX x XY (looking at sex chromosomes)
			- Sex of offspring determined by Father
	- In monohybrid crosses, one parent is homozygous dominant and other is homozygous recessive
		1. Monohybrid = looking at one gene
			- Most traits and phenotypes are more complicated than just two alleles
			- F1 = 3:1 ratio
			- F2 = 1:2:1 ratio
			- ---
	- BB x Bb (If B = brown (dominant) and b = blue (recessive))
		1. 100% of phenotype would be brown
		2. 1 homozygous dominant:1 heterozygous 
		3. 1:1 ratio of BB to Bb
4. Pedigree
	- Square = male and circle = female
	- Horizontal line = marriage and lines down from pairs to children
	- If colored, expressing trait and if white, not expressing trait. If split half-and-half, then heterozygous
		1. Both parents must at least be heterozygous for recessive gene to show in offspring
		2. Recessive gene often skips generations whereas dominant gene shows up in every generation
		3. Carriers of genes are heterozygous as trait is not expressed, but "carried"
5. Dihybrid Crosses
	- Examines two separate traits in a single cross (ex RRYY x rryy)
		1. Gametes of each parent must by RY or ry
			- Both alleles must be present to pass to offspring
		2. F1 will all be RrYy (all dominant phenotype of round + yellow peas)
		3. Crossing RrYy w/ RrYy shows 9:3:3:1 ratio
			- 9 dominant, dominant (RY)
			- 3 recessive, dominant (rY)
			- 3 dominant, recessive (Ry)
			- 1 recessive, recessive (ry)
	- Principle of independent assortment
		1. Alleles assort independently (ex YyRr can produce all combos of gamete genotypes)
			- Only happens if alleles are on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome
		2. If alleles close together on same chromosome, they are said to be linked and therefore do not assort independently or randomly
			- Do not get normal phenotypic ratios if close together
			- Violates normal Medellin outcome
6. Test crosses
	- Only way to determine if homozygous dominant or heterozygous 
	- Crossing unknown individual w/ known recessive
		1. The phenotype ratios differ depending on unknown part
	- If unknown is homozygous dom, offspring must all be dom phenotype
		1. If hetero, offspring may show rec phenotype
	- Pedigrees can indicate this in humans

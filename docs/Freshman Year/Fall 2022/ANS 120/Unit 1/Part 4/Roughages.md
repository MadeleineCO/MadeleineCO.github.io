1. [[Feed Classifications]]
2. NOT fruits, grains, seeds, or tubers 
3. Includes plant stems and leaves
4. High in fiber and low in energy ([[Animal Nutrition|nutrients]])
	1. Fiber: Cellulose (+ related components such as lignin, hemicellulose, wood)
		- Used for structure in plants
		- The higher the fiber, the less room for nutrients ([[Animal Nutrition]])
	2. Proteinaceous (Legumes)
		- Higher in [[Nutrition - Protein|protein]] than other roughages (still low amounts relative to concentrates)
		- Crude Protein (CP) is generally greater than 15% protein
		- Alfalfa
			- Symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium spp. (spp. = species)
				1. Bacteria that live in root nodules of plants
				2. Can take nitrogen out of air and fix it into plants
				3. Nitrogen is the basis of amino acids and proteins so increases protein production in the plant
			- Can be dangerous if too much [[Nutrition - Protein|protein]]
				- Lower in fiber than most roughages (higher in nutrients)
		- Clover
	1. Carbonaceous (Grasses)
		- Bermuda
		- Fescue
		- Orchard grass
		- Timothy
		- Crop residue
			1. Ex: Stems from wheat
		- Low in [[Nutrition - Protein|protein]] and other nutrients but high in fiber
5. Importance
	- Critical for [[Ruminant|ruminants]] and [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]]
		- Provide feed substrate for microbial digestion
		- Maintains gastrointestinal tract (GIT) integrity
			1. [[Horse (Equine)]] need a bunch of it to prevent colic to keep digestive track full
6. Storage
	- Hay Production
		- Trying to decrease the rate of microbial breakdown of forage by decreasing moisture content
		- Forage is 80-50% [[Nutrition - Water|water]] whereas hay is 8-16% water
	- Pellets/Cubes

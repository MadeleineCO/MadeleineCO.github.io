1. Membrane structure
	1. Made of phospholipids arranged in bilayer 
	2. Globular [[protein]] inserted in [[lipid]] bilayer
	3. Fluid mosaic model: mosaic of [[protein|proteins]] floats in or on the fluid lipid bilayer like boats on a pond
		1. [[Protein|proteins]] like ping pong balls in bathtub 
		2. Tennis ball is globular [[protein]]
		3. Can restrict movement w/ tight junctions
		4. Not rigid
2. Phospholipid bilayer ([[Lipid]]) 
	1. Structure consists of Glycerol (3 Carbon polyalcohol)
	2. 2 fatty acids attached to glycerol
		- Nonpolar and hydrophobic
		- ---
	3. Charged phosphate is hydrophilic
	4. Phospholipids cluster with hydrophobic tails
		- ---
	5. Attached to phosphate is amino acid 
		- Cerine is amino acid
		- ---
1. Transmembrane [[protein|proteins]]
	1. Integral membrane [[protein|proteins]]
	2. ---
	4. Trans [[protein|proteins]] work across the membrane
	5. Can be made up of beta sheet [[protein|proteins]] for tunnels or alpha helix proteins with a part inside and a part outside
2. Interior [[protein]] network
	1. Peripheral membrane [[protein|proteins]]
	2. Only work on inside of membrane
3. [[Cell]] surface markers
	1. Glycoproteins and glycolipids
		1. Sugar ([[Carbohydrate]]) + [[protein]] or [[lipid]]
		2. [[Cell]] surface markers
		3. Bacterial [[cell|cells]] have different surface markers
			- How body recognizes foreign substances
		4. Transplant patients must have identical [[cell]] surface markers for success
4. In [[Eukaryotic Cell]], can make cells more or less rigid
	1. Regulated by cholesterol
	2. Cholesterol is hydrophobic
		- More cholesterol = more rigid and vise versa
		- Animal [[cell|cells]] have cholesterol but plant [[cell|cells]] do not
			- [[Animal Cells vs Plant Cells]]
		- Cholesterol has only C and H
			- Makes it nonpolar and very hydrophobic
		- Can be converted into hormones
			- Testosterone and estrogen
			- Removes hydrophobic tail
			- Same ring structure, but two different structures
				1. Estrogen must be converted from testosterone
		- Can't diffuse through membrane
			- How does it get inside [[cell]]?
			- Transport [[protein]]
				1. Two of them
				2. LDL - low density lipoprotein
					1. Can bring it inside [[cell]]
					2. LDL tends to build up in bloodstream (bad)
				3. HDL -  high density lipoprotein
					1. Also transport [[protein]]
					2. ---
		- Glycolipid
			- Can be embedded in membrane cause of hydrocarbon tails
			- ---
5. Membrane [[protein|proteins]]
	1. Functions
		- Transporters
			- [[Protein|proteins]] can create channels for hydrophobic molecules
		- Enzymes
			- Can work to speed up reaction (catalyst)
		- Cell surface receptors
			- Communication
			- ---
		- [[Cell]] surface identity makers
			- Mark as like or foreign
		- [[Cell]] to cell adhesion [[protein|proteins]]
			- ---
			- Junction
		- Attachments to the cytoskeleton
			- ---
	2. Integral membrane [[protein|proteins]]
		- Span the [[lipid]] bylayer (transmembrane [[protein|proteins]])
			- Nonpolar regions are embedded in interior of bilayer
			- Polar regions protrude from both sides of bilayer
			- Single pass transmembrane [[protein]]
				- Can go through once
				- Front = N terminal (outside)
				- Back = c terminal (inside of [[cell]])
			- Triple pass [[protein|proteins]]
				- Can go through three times
			- Beta sheet [[protein]]
				- End terminal and c terminal on same side
				- ---
		- Membrane associated
		- Lipid linked
			- ---
		- [[Protein]] attached
			- Quaternary structure
			- [[Protein]] to protein interaction
	3. HIV binds to CD4 receptor (surface marker), a glycoprotein on the surfaces of T [[cell|cells]]
		1. Brought in by endocytosis
			- 7 pass transmembrane protein are groups of proteins that are one of most abundant transmembrane proteins found in [[cell|cells]]
			- Activated by virus
			- Forms vesicle with virus inside
			- Fuses with lysosome (digestion organelle) that releases virus to rest of [[cell]]
				- Also how cholesterol gets inside [[cell]]
6. Transportation into [[cell|cells]]
	1. Passive transport
		1. Movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration
		2. Does not take energy
		3. Diffusion down the concentration gradient
	2. Makor barrier to crossing membrane is the hydrophobic interior that repels polar molecules bot not nonpolar molecules
		1. Nonpolar molecules move until concentration is equal on both sides
		2. Limited permeability to small polar molecules
		3. Very limited permeability to larger polar molecules and ions
		4. Sugar can't go through - too big

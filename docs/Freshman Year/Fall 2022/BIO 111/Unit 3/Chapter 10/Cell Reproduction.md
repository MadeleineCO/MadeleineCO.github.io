1. Sea urchin begins life as single [[Cell]] that divides to form two cells. After four rounds of cell division, there are 16 cells. After many more rounds, the individual develops into a complex, multicellular [[Organism]] as seen in a mature sea urchin.
	- Different cells are different sizes, determined by signals
	- Common processes across organisms for reproduction
2. [[Prokaryotic Cell|Prokaryote]] vs [[Eukaryotic Cell|Eukaryote]] genomes
	- Prokaryote have *circular* chromosomes whereas eukaryotes have *linear* pieces
		1. Must copy whole genome regardless of type (should be perfectly identical)
	- Prokaryotes in nucleoid whereas eukaryotes in nucleus
	- Sometimes bacteria can accumulate new functions they didn't originally have
		1. Can exchange plasmids 
		2. Basis for antibiotic resistance 
			- Must take full course of antibiotics to wipe out all the bacteria before a mutation can occur w/ resistant gene that is exchange through plasmids
3. Bacteria ([[Prokaryotic Cell]]) - Binary Fission
	- [[Cell]] wall outside of cell membrane
	- Can occur every 20 mins if conditions ideal
		1. Must have all building blocks of [[Macromolecules]]
			- Triglycerides for lipids, [[Amino Acids]] for proteins, monosaccharides for complex carbs, nucleotides for [[Nucleic Acid]]
	- Flagellum is singular, flagella is plural 
		1. Locomotion
	- [[DNA]] in localized in region called nucleoid
	- Circular chromosomal [[DNA]]
		1. [[DNA]] is double stranded in an double helix
	- Plasmid
		1. Circular
		2. To replicate DNA, must separate strands 
			- Origin of replication
				1. Region in plasmid where you separate [[DNA]]
			- Hydrogen bonds are between the different bases ([[Chemical Bonds]])
				1. AT and GC 
				2. ATs only have two H bonds, so easier to break than GC
				3. More ATs in the origin of replication
		3. Enzyme then copies enzyme
			- DNA polymerase
			- Can take and read a single strand
			- Must match complimentary base
			- Only works in one direction
				1. From 5' (front w/ phosphate group) to 3' (back w/ hydroxyl group)
				2. Sides run opposite to each other and where they meet is called point of termination
		4. Then cleavage furrow pinches one [[Cell]] into two cells
			- Cleavage furrow requires [[Protein|proteins]] that help separate and create a permanent boundary between the cells 
				1. Septum is the divider 
4. [[Eukaryote Karyotype]]
5. [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle]]

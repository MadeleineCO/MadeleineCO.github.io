1. Everything alive has evolved from a single source
	1. Tree of life
	2. 50 million yrs ago - land mammals evolved to sea creatures
		1. Before that fish evolved to land animals
2. Most of Earth spent w/ just microbes
	1. Humans very young compared to age of Earth
	2. Mammals appear 200 mil years ago
		1. Land animals (evolved on land)
		2. Whales and dolphins are unique in that they live in the water
			1. Found back of skull in Pakastan in 1978
				1. Similar to back of skull of wolf
				2. Had walnut sized lump on back as apart of inner ear (only found in whales)
			2. Paleontologists wanted to find transitional forms
			3. Reports of whale skeleton sightings in the Sahara
				1. 40 mil yrs ago, the Sahara part of the sea
				2. Valley of whales once a protected bay
					1. Could have birthed young and died there
				3. Most skeletons were of basselosouras (complete water whale)
					1. Discovered leg bones, pelvis, kneecaps, toes
					2. Similar to 50 mil yr old wolf-like animal 
				4. List of known transitional forms now known
				5. Nostrils moved higher up, legs to fins, lost fur, etc.
			4. Ancestry evident in ways whales move
				1. Mammals such as otters and whales ungulate spine up and down
				2. Same way as land animals
3. Land animals product of aquatic animals first
	1. Shift from life in water to life on land
	2. Reptiles, birds, mammals
		1. Common origins in bodies
			1. 4 limbs (tetrapods)
		2. Common ancestor transitioned 370 mil yrs ago
			1. Devonian period
			2. Cliffs of PA once under stream and about the right age
				1. Found smaller shoulder bone (tetrapod shoulder)
					1. Bc found in stream bed, probably lived in water
					2. Developed fingers first then left water
			3. Other early tetrapod fossils found in Greenland
				1. Found forelimb w/ hand at the end
					1. Called Kansasdenger 
					2. Fish like tails and gills, but ends of arms were pedal-shaped
			4. Fish fin follows arm/wrist/hand pattern of human hands
			5. Competition for survival in small streams
				1. Experiments for different survival strategies
				2. Survived by escaping to land
4. Transformation 1/2 a billion yrs ago that led to all animals
	1. Animals appeared 570 million yrs ago in short burst
		1. Cambrian explosion
		2. How did animals seemingly come out of nowhere?
			1. 1913 - Canadian Rockies
				1. Layer of shail containing thousands of fossils 
				2. All sea-dwellers caught in mudslide
				3. Sea floor rose to top of mountain
				4. Trilobites are extinct arthropods w/ external skeletons
				5. Other alien-looking animals
					1. But all had bodies w/ tails, heads, appendages, etc.
				6. Pikaia
					1. Only fossil w/ internal nerve cord resembling a spine
					2. Precursor of fish and so on
		3. All variations of the same theme
			1. Evolution tinkers w/ genes
	2. Embryos and how animals evolve
		1. Start out as clusters of nearly identical cells
		2. Partitions into specialized segments 
		3. William Bateson
			1. Skeletons have underlying structure of repeating segments
			2. Animals occasionally develop w/ things in wrong places
				1. Disruption w/ underlying blueprint
				2. Random changes that might provide fuel for evolution
		4. Radiation, poison, etc. disrupted embryonic development 
			1. Damaged DNA
				1. DNA causes embryo to divide into segments 
				2. DNA made up of segments called genes
		5. Lewis proposed that single genes direct development in flies
			1. Couldn't isolate genes at the time
		6. Antennapedia = antenna leg
			1. Gene thought to control leg growth
			2. If disrupted, legs in wrong places
		7. Began using radioactive probes and toxic enzymes to track individual genes
			1. Thorax gene like master switch that turned on part of embryo that was to become the thorax
		8. If one gene is wrong, changes can occur 
		9. Later isolated eyeless gene that triggers development of eyes in fruit flies
			1. Gene in mice that acts the same way
			2. Took mouse gene and put it in fruit flies
				1. The mouse gene worked perfectly well
				2. Used the same mechanism and gene
		10. Evolution works w/ packets of info and new combinations
			1. Same set of genes
	3. Human transformation
		1. From trees to ground
			1. Over 4 mil yrs
			2. Two legged walking
				1. Movement style of lemurs
					1. Lemur spines are extremely flexible
					2. Early ancestor weren't limited to one motion
						1. Could evolve in different ways
				2. Closest living ancestor is chimp
					1. Chimps don't walk on two feet however
						1. Knuckle walking
						2. Differences in skeletons for different walking styles
5. The Beak of the Finch
	1. Galapagos Islands
		1. Home to unique species 
		2. Finches noticed by Darwin
		3. Volcanic islands that are geologically young
		4. Thirteen species of finches
			1. Diverse habitats
			2. Islands are very different from each other
			3. Different beaks for different food sources
				1. Beaks are like tools
	2. Only one finch species came from common ancestor from the mainland
		1. Known from genetic evidence
		2. How did species change?
			1. Researchers tracked birds over yrs
				1. A drought lasted for 18 months and vegetation disappeared 
				2. Finches had to compete for resources
				3. Turned increasingly to large seeds, which required large beaks
					1. Birds w/ smallest beaks had most trouble 
					2. Over 80% of medium ground finches died
					3. The surviving medium ground finches had larger beaks
					4. In offspring, avg beak size had increased in population 
				4. 5 yrs later, island had 10x more rain than usual
					1. Rain changed vegetation so larger seeds became scarce when drought struck later
					2. Finches w/ small beaks survived and offspring had smaller beaks on avg
		3. Species = group that cannot interbreed w/ other populations
			1. What keeps different species of finches from mating?
				1. Species had different songs that attract males of the same species
				2. Males also attracted to females that have similar size and beak
		4. 2 mil years ago, a single finch species reached the island
			1. Then faced new conditions and became isolated
			2. Traits changed over time
			3. If traits involved mating factors, then species became more isolated and considered new species
		5. Called adaptive radiation

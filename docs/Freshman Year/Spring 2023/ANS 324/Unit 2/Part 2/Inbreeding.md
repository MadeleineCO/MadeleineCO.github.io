1. Inbreeding = mating of individuals that are *more closely related* than the avg of the pop (sire and dam are genetically related)
	1. Increase in homozygosity
		1. Increases frequency of homo genotypes
	2. Inbreeding depression = decline in performance
		1. Inbreeding is the attempt to make individuals more homozygous for superior genes of ancestor
	3. Inbreeding coefficient
		1. The probability that two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent
		2. Reflection of the increased proportion of homo loci in an individual 
		3. Degree of inbreeding (inbreeding coef) is quantified by $F_{x}$
			1. $F_{x}$ measures the percent increase in homozygous gene pairs in the individual relative to the avg of the breed
				1. Ex: If an individual has an Fx of 0.25, what does this tell you?
					1. Fx value for most herd of livestock will *not* be more than 0.5
					2. 0.25 is a probable value
			2. The more closely related, the more severe the inbreeding
		4. Convert pedigrees to arrow diagrams
			1. Arrow diagrams
				1. Individuals may appear only once
				2. Arrows run from ancestors to descendants
				3. Represents flow of genes through time
				4. Each arrow leading away from an individual represents a Mendelian segregation of genes
					1. A sample of half of each parent's genes are transmitted to offspring
			2. Ex: Individual X is inbred bc sire and dam are half siblings
				1. Pedigree read from right to left

	4. Common ancestor
		1. In general, a common ancestor is an ancestor common to more than one individual
		2. When talking about inbreeding, a common ancestor refers to an ancestor common to parents of an inbred 
			1. ![[Pasted image 20230220104414.png]]
		3. Flow of genes from A to X
			1. S and D can inherit identical copies of a gene from A
				1. X can inherit that gene from both S and D (homozygous)
				2. Therefore, the gene is *identical by descent*
				3. This is why the result of inbreeding is an increase in homozygosity beyond what would be found in a randomly mating pop
			2. Can have alleles that are "alike in state"
				1. Refers to having the same alleles (HH) but *not* traceable to a common ancestor
				3. Linebreeding
					1. Less intense form of inbreeding
						1. Concentrates genes of one common ancestor
					2. Mating individuals within a particular line
					3. Designed to maintain a substantial degree of relationship to highly regarded ancestor
					4. Often used in the horse industry
	4. Effects of Inbreeding
		1. *Prepotency*
			1. Performance of offspring is especially like that of parent
				1. Especially uniform
				2. "likeness" or less offspring variation
			2. Attempt to make individuals more homozygous for superior genes
			3. The degree to which an animal will pass his or her characteristics consistently
		2. Expression of deleterious recessive alleles
			1. Gives inbreeding a bad reputation
			2. Does not create deleterious recessive alleles
			3. Increased *expression* of detrimental genes
			4. Does *not* increase frequency of detrimental alleles
				1. Mating systems only change genotypic frequency, not allelic frequency
		3. Inbreeding Depression
			1. Seen in quantitative traits
				1. In polygenic traits, individual effects of genes are small, but taken together, can decrease performance
			2. Decrease in performance of inbreds for traits like fertility and survivability
			3. Unfavorable gene combination value
				1. Result of increased homozygosity
				2. Change in genotypic frequency
			4. Not all quantitative traits are equally affected
				1. Repro and health - seriously affected
				2. Production - moderately affected
				3. Product quality - little affected
		4. Tends to "fix" characteristics (traits) in a pop
		5. Concentrates genes
			1. Either good or bad
		6. Increases P (probability) of getting similar genes to offspring from ancestor
	5. Measuring Inbreeding
		1. Sewell Wright
		2. Formula$$Fx = \sum_{n=1}^{k}(1/2)^{n1+n2+1}(1 + Fa)$$
			2. Fx = inbreeding coefficient of individual X
			3. N is number of segregations of genes (matings) between common ancestors and sire and dam of X
				1. n1 = the number of generations separating the common ancestor from the sire of X
				2. n2 = the number of generations separating the common ancestor from the dam of X
			4. Fa is inbreeding coefficient of common ancestor
			5. k = the number of common ancestors 
		3. Ex #1![[Pasted image 20230222103723.png]]
			1. Number of generations separating X from both Sire and Dam is 1
			2. No relationship is shown behind A, so the inbreeding coef is just 0 
			3. (1/2) to the third power multiplied by (1 + 0) is simply (1/2) to the third power
		4. Ex: #2![[Pasted image 20230222104216.png]]
			1. Interpretation: About 3% of individual X's genes are coming from ancestor A
		5. Ex: #3![[Pasted image 20230222104634.png]]
			1. A Sire x Daughter Mating produces 0.25 for Fx
		6. Ex: #4![[Pasted image 20230222104939.png]]
			1. Fx = 0
			2. Would only have two common ancestors if both A and B were related to the sire
		7. Ex: #5![[Pasted image 20230224101138.png]]
			1. Involves two common ancestors, so after following the formula for each, sum them together
			2. Reminder: Fx will *never* be greater than 0.5

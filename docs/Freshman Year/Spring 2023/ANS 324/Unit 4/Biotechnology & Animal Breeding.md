1. Biotechnology
	1. Broadly defined as applying biological knowledge to practical needs
	2. Animal Breeding Perspectives 
		1. Two categories
			1. Reproductive technologies
				1. AI
				2. Estrus Synchronization
				3. Embryo Transfer
				4. Sex Control
					1. Can determine if embryo is male or female and send it to the right operations
				5. Cloning
					1. Faster genetic gain
					2. Asexual reproduction
			2. Molecular technologies
				1. DNA Fingerprinting
					1. Can test which sire is responsible for calves 
					2. Can correct faulty pedigree records
				2. Marker Assisted Selection
					1. Can select for animals that give you more tender meat (calpain gene)
					2. Can associate gene w/ phenotype to predict performance
				3. Gene Transfer
					1. Transgenic
					2. Producing animals that are not carrying a gene that is native to their pop
					3. Ex: goat + lysosine gene to produce better milk that is more shelf-stable
					4. Ex: golden rice (produces more vitamin A)
				4. Genomic Selection
				5. Gene Editing
2. Extent of Impact of Biotechnology in Animal Breeding
	1. Depends on four factors
		1. Effectiveness
		2. Practicality
		3. Cost
		4. Public Perception
			1. Public perception about cloning has not changed much - negative
			2. Perception about GMOs - negative

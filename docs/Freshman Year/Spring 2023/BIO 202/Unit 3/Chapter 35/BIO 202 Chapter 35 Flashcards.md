^1679625168378

Neuron Function::Dendrites receive info; Cell body produces neurotransmitters; Axon transmits info; Synaptic terminals release neurotransmitters (exocytosis)
^1679625168386

[[2023-03-25]]
Animal cells like to be surrounded in --- solutions::isotonic (same concentration of solute to water in extracellular fluid as the cell itself)
^1679779336563

Semipermeable cell membranes have distinct ---::disparities between inside and outside; Called the electrochemical gradient
^1679779336573

Electrochemical gradient results from a ---::concentration difference (if nothing stopping the solute, it will move along its concentration difference); Ions also have electrical (charge) differences and move based on their electrical gradients
^1679779336581

Usually, a cell is very --- inside so positive ions want to travel ---::negative (-70mV); inside
^1679779336588

Depolarization::When cell becomes less negative as positive ions enter
^1679779336596

Cells have potassium and sodium channels that are --- gated::voltage; Must reach certain change level before it can open completely, allowing ions to move into or out of the cell
^1679779336603

Proteins are generally --- to membranes bc they are too large::impermeable; Wholistic negative charge
^1679779336611

Diffusion and Resting Potential State::(H) -> (L); (++) -> (+); Proteins (-) cannot diffuse through and make cell more negative; Cl-, Na+ (outside), and K+ (inside)
^1679779336618

Resting Potential::Neuron in its resting, unstimulated state; Usually -70mV inside cell; Linked w/ K+ permeability (potassium pumped inside cell and sodium pumped outside cell; cells more permeable to K+ bc more channels)
^1679779336625

Movement of positive ions inside or outside the cell can change the ---::resting potential of -70mV; Depolarization to create action potential 
^1679779336632

Maintaining resting potential relies upon two structures, ---::Na-K Pump (3 NA+ out per two K+ in using ATP) and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels (K+ more common than Na+ so cell more permeable to K+)
^1679779336702

Ion channels allow ions to travel according to their ---::concentration gradient when open; K+ normally "leaks" out (like a leaky faucet even when closed, but much more can diffuse when open)
^1679779336709

Chemical gradient::K+ (generally) passively diffuses out of the cell but opening voltage-gated ion channels can increase the rate drastically
^1679779336716

Electrical gradient::K+ must be actively transported into the cell using ATP bc inside of cell is negative; Uses Na-K pump
^1679779336723

Action Potential Graphic #1::![[Pasted image 20230325141758.png]]
^1679779336732

Depolarize::When a cell becomes less negative; Occurs as more Na+ ions enter the cell; Must surpass threshold for full action potential
^1679779336741

Repolarize::When a cell becomes more negative; Occurs via pumping K+ ions inside the cell (and three Na+ out)
^1679779336749

Hyperpolarize::When the cell is made more negative than the resting potential (-70mv); Cannot be restimulated while hyperpolarized (about 1 ms)
^1679779336757

The --- pump is important for getting cell back to resting potential::sodium-potassium
^1679779336765

Voltage-gated ion channels::Na+ or K+; Only open at thresholds; More and more will open until maximum action potential is reached after stimulation
^1679779336774

If a small stimulus does not reach threshold (about -55 mV), then neuron isn't fired (failed initiation); Just a small addition of Na+ (slight depolarization)

If a strong stimulus reaches the threshold, then  cell is --- and action potential is created::depolarized (enough Na+ enters); Neuron then stimulates another neuron (like dominoes)
^1679779336784

Action Potential Graphic #2::![[Pasted image 20230324111447.png]] Arrow going up = depolarization and arrow going down = repolarization; Resting potential = -70mV and threshold is about -55mV
^1679779336792

Action Potential Steps::1 - Na+ channels open in response to stimulus (depolarization begins); 2 - K+ channels open (cell reaches +50 mV (peak)); 3 - Na+ channels close but K+ still leaves cell; 4 - K+ channels close; 5  - Brief moment where cell is hyperpolarized and cannot fire again
^1679779336805

An overload of potassium can be caused by ---::lethal injection; Cells must be able to move Na+ in and K+ out to create action potential, but this causes K+ concentration so high outside cell that cell cannot work hard enough to create action potential and nerves cannot fire
^1679779336814

Action potential happens throughout the ---::axon; As you depolarize one part, the next is then depolarized and so on (dominoes effect or the wave); This is how *unmyelinated axon* propagates signal
^1679779336824

Most of our cells are ---::myelinated; Adding insulation w/ the Schwann's cells w/ nodes between allows signal to jump from node to node (AP occurs only at nodes allowing for a smaller neuron but faster signal - called *saltatory conduction*)
^1679779336832

A message through a tube is restricted by diameter. This is called ---::resistance; Increase in diameter = less resistance (signal flows more readily); Saltatory conduction allows myelinated neurons to be smaller but faster 
^1679779336842

Myelinated neuron vs unmyelinated neuron (table)::![[Pasted image 20230324112553.png]]

^1679779336900

Synaptic vesicles::Store neurotransmitters by the axon terminal
^1679779336909

Flow of signal from one neuron to another cell::AP -> NT -> AP; AP of presynaptic cell (electrical) -> neurotransmitter (chemical form of signal) -> Causes AP of postsynaptic cell (electrical)
^1679779336917

Nerve impulses cause AP to stimulate ---::CA^2, which causes the exocytosis of NTs into the synapse; NTs then bind to ligand gated channels (require chemical to open) so that Na+ can enter cell (causes depolarization and propagates AP)
^1679779336926

NT duration is tightly controlled by ---::enzymes, reuptake, etc; Don't want neuron to always be "on" 
^1679779336935

Neurotransmitter::A substance that transmits nerve impulses across a synapse; Chemical; Stored in synaptic vesicles; Exocytosis of pre-synaptic cell
^1679779336944

^1679779336964

Acetylcholine (ACh)::Ligand that binds at neuromuscular junction; Excitatory postsynaptic potential

^1679779336983

gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); Important inhibitor of brain function; Increases effectiveness of anxiety medications; Inhibitory postsynaptic potential 

Inhibitory postsynaptic potential::Bind w/ ligand-gated Cl- (AP -> inhibitory; opens it); When Cl- enters cell, it makes cell more negative (hyperpolarizes)
^1679779336992

^1679779337000

Dopamine (NT)::Body movement linked w/ pleasure pathway

^1679779337031

^1679779337040

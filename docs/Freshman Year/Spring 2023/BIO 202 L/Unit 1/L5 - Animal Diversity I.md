1. Five Different Phyla
	1. DK*P*COFGS
	2. Binomial nomenclature
	3. C.S. = cross section
	4. W.M. = whole mount
	5. I.S. = longitudinal section 
	6. Animal must ingest their food
		1. Heterotrophic 
	7. Porifera
		1. The simplest phylum
		2. Consists of sponges 
			1. Aquatic organisms
			2. The simplest animals 
		3. Asymmetrical
		4. Crude radial symmetry
		5. No definitive tissues
		6. Exhibit cell specialization level of organization using different cell types
		7. Filter feeders
		8. Spongin fibers in most of these animals provide structural support
	8. Cnidaria
		1. Aquatic organisms 
		2. Radial symmetry
		3. Diploblasts 
			1. Ectoderm + Endoderm
		4. Two main body forms are polyp and medusa, usually possessing stinging tentacles that utilize nematocysts to capture prey
			1. Predidation 
			2. Polyp is stationary
				1. Ex: hydra, sea anemones, coral
			3. Medusa is mobile
				1. Ex: jellyfish
			4. Some transition between stages while others stay in one form their whole lives
		5. Epidermis is derived from the ectoderm
		6. Gastrodermis is derived from the endoderm

		8. Asexual reproduction can occur through budding
			1. Also capable of sexual reproduction
	9. Platyhelminthes
		1. Flatworms
			1. Worm-like
			2. Some are free-living in freshwater
			3. Some are parasitic
				1. Ex: tapeworms, flukes

		2. Acoelomates
		3. Bilateral symmetry
		4. Display cephalization and an incomplete gut
		5. Triploblasts
		6. Nervous system w/ brain and excretory system w/ flame cells
		7. Muscles provide body support
		8. Sexual and asexual reproduction
	11. Rotifera
		1. Rotifers
		2. Aquatic freshwater animal
		3. Pseudocoelomates
		4. Bilateral
		5. Both a head and a complete gut

		9. Filter feeder
	12. Nematoda 
		1. Roundworms
			1. Parasitic
			2. Sexual dimorphism
				1. Male = Smaller, hooked end w/ spines by anus
				2. Female = longer and larger, lobes by anterior end, genital poor a third down from anterior
		2. Complete digestive system w/ mouth and anus

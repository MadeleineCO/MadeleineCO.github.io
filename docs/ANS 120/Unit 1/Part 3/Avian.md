1. [[Domestication]]
	1. Relatively recently domesticated
		- Chickens
			- Broiler = meat
	2. Turkeys
		- Few species from North America
		- The domesticated turkey can no longer breed
			- Bred for white breast meat
			- Males are too big to physically breed
			- Bred ability to fly out
2. [[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]]
	1. [[Avian]]/Modified [[Monogastric]]
		- Carnivore
		- Omnivore
		- Granivore
		- Frugivore
		- Insectivore
		- Minor differences between different birds and diets
	2. Mouth/Beak = Prehension
		- NO mastication
	3. Crop = mild chemical digestion and moistens ingested material
		- Pouch located outside the body
		- No strong acids/bases
	4. Proventriculus = the abomasum 
		- Gastric stomach
		- Chemical digestion
	5. Gizzard
		- Mastication (mechanical digestion)
		- Very thick pouch; strong muscles
			- Smashes the ingested material
		- Birds eat small rocks (grit) to get minerals and to help pulverize food in the gizzard
			- Grit increases surface area grinding food + minerals
	6. Small intestines
		- Proximal = chemical digestion/absorption
		- Distal = absorption 
	7. Ceca
		- 2 ceca whereas most animals have one cecum
		- NOT for microbial digestion
		- Place for mixing and short term storage of urine and feces
			- Birds don't have a bladder
			- Made up of smooth muscle that can spontaneously contract for defecation 
				1. Comes out the cloaca ("common opening")
					1. Reproductive component comes out that way as well
	1. Large intestine
		- Water metabolism
3. Avian Breeds
	-  Domesticated --- yrs ago
	- Primary chicken breeds
		1. Egg laying breeds
			- White leghorn
			- Frizzles - have upturned feathers
			- Ayam Cemani - produce 10x more melanin than normal (very black); Predominantly found in Malasia
		1. Meat breeds
			- Broiler - number one farm commodity in ga
			- Silkie - Japanese bread w/ black meat and silky feathers
	- Turkey breeds
		1. Bronze, White, Bourbon, Narragan
		2. Bred to be so large that we must reproduce by AI
	- Geese breeds
		1. Mostly out of Africa
		2. Brown and White Chinese
		3. Feathers, meat, and eggs
	- Duck breeds
		1. Perkin
		2. Orrington
		3. Muscovy
		4. Feathers, meat, and eggs
	- We also raise undomesticated birds
		1. Ratites
			- Ostriches and Emus
			- They don't have middle breast bone bc they don't fly
			- Produce large eggs
			- Mostly for production of other components such as leather, ostrich meat (red meat)
	- Quail hunting

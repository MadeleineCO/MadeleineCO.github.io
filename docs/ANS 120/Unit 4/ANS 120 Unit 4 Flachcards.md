National Equine Census::Num of horses dropped from early 1900s (replaced by motor vehicles, especially tractors); All time low at 1960 (only work horses left) but then num increased due to recreation interest
^1667349552544

1986 - Tax Reform Act::Wealthy people used to build horse farms to intentionally lose money so that they didn't have to pay as much in tax (making money by losing money); This act ended the practice so horse num dropped again after 1986

^1667349552608

Rods::In the retina; Work in low-light conditions; The tapetum (reflective layer of cells behind retina) causes light to bounce back onto rods, amplifying light; Allows horses to see even better in dark than we can
^1667349552614

Most animals have --- rods and --- cones::more; fewer; humans are opposite so see worse in low light conditions that animals such as horses
^1667349552620

Horses have eyes closer to --- of the head::sides; Provides 357* vision w/ blind spots directly in front and directly behind; Stereoscopic (long range depth perception) is better in horses, but short range depth perception is poor

^1667435382472

Founder – Laminitis::Inflammation of foot (many causes); Separation of sensitive and insensitive laminae; Lose support of P-3 – rotation; Tend to stand with inflicted foot forward
^1667435382477

Conformation Importance of Limb::Elongation of limbs and use for locomotion make  
^1667435382482
structural features extremely important

Front limb ideal side position::Dissipates energy into muscle of humerus/scapula) – floating scapula; Note: Importance of slope of the shoulder – more horizontal the better (Dissipation of energy (less stress on joints); Floating scapula + favorable slope = Greater stride length)
^1667435382487

Problematic front limb side positions::Camped under – Increase damage to knee and fetlock joint; Camped out – Some damage to fetlock and knee; Knee sprung (Buck knee) – Interferes with normal locomotion and extension; Calf knee – Rare – Severe knee damage
^1667435382492

Ideal front limb forward position::Send energy up through center of bones to dissipate.  
^1667435382498

Problematic front limb forward positions::Bow legged, base narrow, knock kneed - increase potential damage to knee and fetlock joints; Toed-out – Tend to wing in (balance) – can interfere (front strike front); Toed-in - Tend to paddle out – no interfering (Note: Foals – Born toed out; Born with 70% of limb length (body grows into legs); Toed out allows for expansion of the chest)
^1667435382503

Hind Limbs – Side view Ideal position::General: Dissipation of energy through hock into hip; Note: Ideal may depend on objectives; Stands directly under rear shortens stride – decreases extension (reach) but “ideal” for horses that need to get weight under themselves rapidly (reining, cutting, roping); Camped out causes extreme stress on leg joint; Post-legged – Too straight through hip and dissipates energy upward through  
^1667435382508
rider

^1667530921791

Dichromic::Horses::Two cones (one for blue spectrum (short wavelengths) and middle/long wavelengths (yellow/red spectrum; earthy tones))
^1667530921796

Equine eye summary::Greater low light vision (rods + tapetum); Limited color vision (dichromic - short wave + middle/long); Limited accommodation ("distance focused")
^1667530921802

The length of horse limbs has ---::increased; Pros = increased height (helpful for vision) and increased stride length (*potential* to increase speed; speed = stride length x stride frequency); Cons = increased weight (slower movement) and higher CG (stability problem)
^1667530921808

Solutions to problems w/ long horse limbs::Eliminate excess weight (bone and muscle in lower portion of legs); Increase stability w/ semi-flexible spine (not very twistable backbone; more stable), fusion of radius/ulna in front legs (cannot twist legs), and fusion of tibial/fibula in hind legs

Horse Digestive Anatomy::Non-Ruminant Herbivore (esophagus --> gastric stomach --> small intestine --> large intestine --> cecum); 35g capacity
^1667530921919

If both horse and cow are 1000 lbs, feed intake is ---::similar; Horses have 35 gal capacity (vs 60 gal) and smaller GIT so faster rate of passage than cows (must eat more frequently than cows); More muscle/unit mass vs bovine; Horse designed for running
^1667530921928

Horses eat about --- hrs of the day::20; Take cat naps throughout; Prone to colic when in stalls bc of confinement, not  enough fiber to maintain GIT integrity (and keep it from twisting)
^1667530921937

O2 capacity::O2 used in ATP production and necessary for muscle contractions; Head designed for large amount of air intake (large diameter and separate nasal passages; do not breath through trachea so cannot choke)
^1667530921944

[[2022-11-04]]
If not enough O2, animals go into ---::anaerobic metabolism; Still have muscle contractions but creates lactic acid (sore and stiff muscles)
^1667583208865

Equine Spleen::In most species, spleen recycles RBCs; Horses can also use spleen for storage of RBCs as well; Can increase hematocrit (proportion of all cells to plasma fluid) by 10-20% by releasing stored RBCs from the spleen; When feeling out of breath, a horse can increase num of RBSs so it can carry more oxygen (avoiding anaerobic metabolism)
^1667583208878

Slow rate of contraction::Low efficiency (limited work; limited heat - friction); Walk = 4 beat gait
^1667583208885

Fast rate of contraction::Low efficiency; High work; High heat - friction; Canter = 3 beat gait
^1667583208892

^1667583208899

Conformation of horse::Putting the "parts together"; Function to form (we select different characteristics to match function; ex draft vs light)
^1667583208906

Ideal conformation::Head and neck important for balance and flexibility as well as air intake, refined head, straight shot for air, large eyes, shorter loin/back, lot of muscle in hindquarters, deep girth; Back should match front
^1667583208913

[[2022-11-07]]
Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)::Simple *lethal* recessive disorder; Like switch that turns immune system off, causing horses to quickly die after birth from any infection
^1667865988615

Most recessive lethal disorders are less than --- of population in the wild::1-3%; However, we kept breeding heterozygotes so at some point, up to 40% of Arabians were carriers; We tend to not select against known genetic defects
^1667865988630

Lethal genetic disorders::Dead whereas detrimental genetic disorders are severely impactful; SCID is an example of a lethal genetic disorder
^1667865988638

^1667865988659

Equine gestation::365 days; Can vary some
^1667865988666

Horses have very short parturition bc of ---::diffuse placental attachment; 17 min parturition and placenta gone by about 1 hr; The quicker the parturition, the less vulnerable
^1667865988674

Horse foals are up within ---::hour; Gets colostrum ("first milk"); Mare produces lots of milk but has small udder bc foal nurses often
^1667865988680

Equine repro cycle::Day 0 = breeding (may); Day 335 = foaling (april); Foal heat occurs 9-14 days postpartum; Day 390 = normal cycling (bred; june)
^1667865988687

Foal heat::About 40% of mares demonstrate estrus 9-14 days postpartum; Of that 40%, 40% will get pregnant if bred by male (less likely to get pregnant but most breeders try so they can save time); Shorter estrus (1-3 days)
^1667865988694

The physiological purpose of foal heat is to ---::increase estrogen to increase blood flow to uterus, including more WBCs and nutrients; Allows for more tissue repair to help the uterine involution process; For repair, not reproduction (breeders try for repro anyway)
^1667865988703

If horses not impregnated during foal heat, it takes at least 60 days for ---::return to normal estrous cycles bc of long gestation, uterine involution, and lactational anestrous
^1667865988710

Horses have the --- reproduction rate::lowest; physiological reasons include long gestation (about 365 days), seasonal (long day) breeding, single offspring, and long time to reach puberty and maturity
^1667865988716

Artificially induced reasons horses have low repro rate include ---::Jan 1 birth date (we want horses to come earlier in the year bc for competitions, they all fall under same birth year; earlier provides more time for training and growth within year group); Not bred based on reproduction; Artificially induced reasons = man-made reasons
^1667865988724

[[2022-11-09]]
All foals born between Jan 1 and Dec 31 are the same --- relative to competition::age; earlier is better for comp purposes and horses born earlier in year tend to have development and training advantage; Incentive to breed early
^1668107409028

Most horse breeders try to start in --- then stop in ---::Feb; June; Horses don't start estrus until later in spring (about march-may and peak on june 21); Breeders start when horses don't want to breed (during transition from anestrous to normal estrous cycles) but stop when they do want to breed; Causes lower repro rate for horses overall
^1668107409040

Light barn::Tries to mimic light to start equine estrous cycles earlier (closer to Feb); Very difficult and expensive
^1668107409047

Horses are not bred base on ---::reproduction; Based on performance; If animals have repro issues, we don't select against them and don't eliminate problems; Contributes to lower repro rates as well as genetic disorders such as SCID
^1668107409053

Cornea (ansl)::Protective layer of cells to protect the interior components of the eye; Also acts as a lens due to bending of light effect

Rods (ansll)::Sensory nerve cell responsible for perception of low light vision; Respond to low intensity light within a specific range of wave lengths
^1668107561453

Cones (ansl)::Sensory nerve cells responsible for perception of color vision; Different types of cones respond to limited wavelengths of light; Stimulation of cones provide perception of color within the brain
^1668107409064

Tapetum (ansl)::Layer of reflective cells located behind the retina in some species (such as horses); Reflects photons of light that can potentially stimulate additional rods under low light conditions; The net effect is amplification of available light to enhance vision under low light conditions
^1668107409070

Accommodation (ansl)::The ability of the lens of the eye to change shape; The greater accommodation of the lens, the more ability to focus at short and long distances
^1668107552775

Diopters::Measure of accommodation (more diopters = greater ability for lens to change shape and focus at short and long distances); Horses have 1-2 diopters (limited accommodation suited mainly for long distances) while humans have many more (greater ability to focus at different distances)
^1668107409077

Vision is important for understanding ---::behavior of animals; Primary sense we try to manipulate
^1668107409083

The electromagnetic spectrum::Visible spectrums can vary between species; Radio = too long for us to hear; X-rays small enough to go through soft tissue but not hard (ex bone); Gamma rays so small that they can go through you completely
^1668107409090

Specialized smooth muscles allow for ---::accommodation; Contraction = relaxation and vise versa; Humans = 10 diopters; Dogs and Horses = 1-2
^1668107409096

Nearsightedness and farsightedness differ from ---::accommodation; nearsightedness = too long eye; too much bending while farsightedness = too short eye; too little bending
^1668107409103

Rods (ansl)::Slow depolarization in low light; Less resolution (rods are more spread out); More rods = brighter images 
^1668107409109

The brain and vision::Depth perception (horses have side eyes); What left eye and right eye sees differs (brain puts images together); Image is inverted when entering eyes
^1668107409115

Nerves have ---::action potentials and recovery time; Flick fusion rates differ between species (humans = 50 seconds; Dogs = 70-80 seconds (faster = picks up motion better))
^1668107409122

Pets are relatively uncommon in ---::most countries; Recent trend in affluent countries such as the US; Only bc more common in the last 50 years 
^1668108412298

^1668108412352

Dogs were domesticated through ---::self domestication ("village dump analogy"); Developed some tameness before humans took and specialized them
^1668108412360

Human intervention - dog specialization::Strict captivity and limited breeding; Intentional breeding (looking for specific traits); Trait standardization (define breeds and traits; certain phenotypes = certain breed)
^1668108412367

Genetic firewall::Minimize genes from wild species due to inability for domesticated dogs to breed w/ wolves (toy poodle cannot breed w/ wolves)
^1668108412374

Russian scientist Dimitri Belyaev - Russian silver fox experiments::Bred silver foxes in captivity for 60 years and directly selected for temperament (classified as aggressive fearful, extremely aggressive, fearful, or quiet); Selected quiet for breeding; Reverse flight zone
^1668108412382

By 8th generation of silver fox breeding, ---::white stars appeared on foreheads, they had floppier ears, play in adulthood, barking, dog-like coat, changes in estrous cycles, and more
^1668108412390

^1668270181427

Dogs have about --- olfactory bulbs while humans have about ---::6g; 1.5g; 40x proportion of dog brain dedicated to smell; Important sense for dogs
^1668270181433

Turbinate bones::Bones located inside the sinus passages; Location for olfactory nerves (specialized nerves that pick up scent); More swirly bones moves air around more (more surface area, greater chance that molecules will bind to olfactory nerves bc of air movement)

^1668607325774

Use of dogs by humans::Tracking (follows both scent and sight; slow but accurate and specific); Trailing (follows scent only; faster but less accurate; wind makes big difference)
^1668607325781

We can use dogs for ---::detection (drug tracking, sniffing out diseases such as cancer, response to termites); Training for detection can be challenging (must have scents in isolated containers and train dog to have positive response; Older dogs are less sensitive, may respond to container that used to have something)
^1668607325787

Canine Gustatory Appeal (Taste)::Taste bud = sensory nerve; If stimulated, action potential goes to brain
^1668630019087

Number of taste buds across species::cows = 25000, rabbits = 17000, humans = 9000, dogs = 1700, cats = 475; Herbivores tend to have higher numbers of taste sensory nerves while carnivores have fewer (omnivores have medium number)

Herbivores eat large variety of foods and need to sort nutrients out so they have ---::more taste buds than carnivores (which eat only other animals have have less need for taste buds)
^1668630019106

Salty taste buds detect ---::minerals we need for nutrients; Humans are omnivores (which eat high meat diet but lower in fruits and veggies); Dogs are mostly omnivores but have less developed salty taste buds (>80% meat based diet)

Simplistic sensory receptors::Primary types are pressure receptors (40% located on face) and vibrissae (whiskers); Temperature (primarily cold); Pain
^1668630019190

Vibrissae::Whiskers; When they bend, nerve is stimulated so animals can sense something without running into it; Blind dogs can do fine as long as they have vibrissae; Horses have whiskers to but sometimes we cut them off for show; Neuro-reflex response
^1668630019196

Neuro-reflex response::Reflex response that makes eyelids close when whiskers are stimulated

^1668630019242

The follicular phase lasts about ---::18 days; 9 days of proestrus w/ increase in follicle development and hormone levels (especially E2 and T); Estrus lasts the following 9 days (period of receptivity to be bred by male); Ovulation occurs near end of estrus
^1668630019248

The luteal phase follows the ---::follicular phase; Includes diestrus and lasts about 2 months; Development of the corpus luteum and rise in P4 (no matter whether they are pregnant or not)
^1668630019254

^1668630019267

Estimated number of animals euthanized in the USA::4-6 million per year; Alternative to waste? - dog meat (normal meat nutritional value; common in other countries and societies; About 10.73 lbs of lean meat per animal so we are losing over 53 million lbs per year); 7 states have outlawed the slaughter of cats and dogs for human consumption due to societal resistance 
^1668630019273

Breeds of Dogs::Estimated 350-400 breeds but 189 recognized by the AKC; We have propagated genetic disorders through reproduction (hundreds of diseases bc we fail to select against these genetic problems)
^1668630019279

Gene Linkage::When genes of different traits tend to move together in gametes (which are haploid); Ex: coat color does *not* cause hearing loss or vise versa, but they white dogs tend to be deaf (20% of all dalmatians are deaf in one ear and 8% in both; in blue-eyed dalmatians, about 50% are deaf)
^1668630019285

What happens to a breed when its job is gone?::We change breeds from practical to fit our desires (problems arise); Ex: bulldogs now have shortened head, broadened hips, wrinkly skin w/ issues bc we no longer use them for work; Greyhound racing is now banned - what will we do to them next?; When a dog loses its job, we end up losing the dog (propagate issues)
^1668630019292

Examples of ways we have messed up dogs::Double muscling (not agile, not ideal for dog), ugly dog contests; loving pets to death (level of obesity increasing; most animals designed for scarcity)

Cats go easily ---::feral; Can reproduced very quickly; Not very social animals; This is a problem bc cats carry parasites or diseases that can be zoonotic and kill off birds and small mammals
^1668705603929

Feral trapping of cats::Trap - Spay - Rehab (difficult bc one generation can go back to wild state); Trap - Spay/Neuter - Release (repro control (non lethal), expensive, does not remove the problem bc you can't reach critical mass to make true difference; Can still hunt animals and carry parasites/disease)
^1668705603936

Australia paid people to ---::shoot cats; Wisconsin tried similar idea but didn't work; Trying to remove feral cat problem

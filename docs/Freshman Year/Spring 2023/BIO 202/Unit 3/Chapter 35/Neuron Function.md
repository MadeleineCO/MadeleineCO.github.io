1. Diversity of Nervous Systems
	1. Basal groups tend to have collections of neurons called ganglia
		1. Like little brains
	2. Mammals have more extensive central nervous systems 
		1. As you go along vertebrate evolution, brains get more intricate and intelligence increases 
2. Specialties of Neurons
	1. "nerve cell"
	2. Specialized cell that transmits nerve impulses
	3. Sensory neurons = "afferent neurons"
		1. Sensory cell -> CNS
		2. Generates action potential from stimulation 
	4. Motor neurons = "efferent neurons"
		1. CNS -> Motor effector (e.g. muscle cell)
	5. Interneurons
		1. Transmits signals between other neurons
		2. Neurons may link up w/ spinal cord, which contains these interneurons
			1. Some reflexes don't go all the way to the brain
3. Neuron Structure
	1. Multipolar neuron
		1. Dendrites = extensions of the cell body
			1. Receive signals
		2. Cell body w/ nucleus 
		3. Axon = long section 
			1. Schwann's Cells provide insulation
				1. Collectively known as mylon sheath
				2. Spaces in-between are called nodes of ranvier
					1. Increases nerve pulse
		4. Axon Terminals = Give signals to dendrites of another neuron 
	2. Signal -> Dendrites -> Cell body -> Axon -> Axon Terminal

4. Types of Neurons
	1. Unipolar
		1. One structure
		2. Away from soma
		3. Only found in insects
	2. Bipolar
		1. One dendrite
		2. One axon terminal
		3. Ex: retinal cells
	3. Multipolar
		1. Most common
		2. Found in CNS
		3. Branching dendrites
		4. Ex: Purkinji cells
	4. Pseudounipolar
		1. One process away
		2. Process branches
		3. Most sensory cells
			1. Pain, touch, smell, etc.
	5. --- insert images
5. Neuron Function
	1. Dendrites receive info
	2. Cell body produces neurotransmitters
	3. Axon transmits info
	4. Synaptic terminals release neurotransmitters
		1. Exocytosis
	5. Myelin sheath insulate transmission (increase speed)
	6. Nodes of Ranvier are for impulse conduction (increase speed)
6. Types of Receptors
	1. Photo = related to vision
		2. Rods for low-light detection 
		3. Cones for color
	3. Mechano = related to movement
		1. Tactile
			1. Touch
		2. Auditory
			1. Hairs in ears move based on sound waves
			2. High-intensity sounds can physically damage ears 
	4. Chemo = related to chemicals 
		1. Olfactory
			1. Salt, sweet, umami, bitter, sour
				1. Each taste is helpful in some way
				2. Ex: bitter = do not eat
		2. Gustatory
		3. pH, O2, glucose
	5. Thermo = related to temperature
	6. Baro = related to blood pressure
7. Neuroglia - Support Cells
	1. Nerves require lots of energy
		1. Can't do much beside transmit signals
		2. Neuroglia feed the neurons 
	2. Schwann Cells (PNS)
		1. Myelinate one neuron
			1. Can only myelinate one neuron
	3. Oligodendrocytes
		1. Myelinate multiple neurons
	4. Astrocytes (CNS)
		1. Interact w/ capillaries and neurons
		2. Nourish and regulate ion concentrations
		3. Forms the blood brain barrier
			1. Lie between blood and the brain to protect against toxins
		4. Structural support of synapse
			1. Synapse is where info is exchanged
	5. Microglia (CNS)
	6. Peripheral macrophages (PNS)
		1. Recycles and repairs damaged cells 
		2. Functions like an immune system for the brain
			1. Our immune system is not connected to the brain (protects against any immune disorders)
			2. Provides some microorganism protection
	7. Satellite glia (PNS)
		1. Provides nutrients and structure
	8. Radial glia (CNS)
		1. Scaffolding
		2. Guides developing neurons
	9. Ependymal (CNS)
		1. Line fluid-filled cavities
			1. Spinal fluid is meant to be sterile
		2. Cerebralspinal fluid homeostasis
		3. Waste clearance

I. Made from [[Amino Acids]]
	A. 20 amino acids
	B. Have central (alpha) carbon
		- Amino group bonded to alpha C
		- Each amino acid has different R group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature
	C. Side chain
		- Structure is different for different [[Amino Acids]]
		- Some have only H and C
			a. If only H and C, it is hydrophobic and non polar ([[Water]])
			b. Not same shape
		- Some are polar
			a. Can be charge
		- Some have complex ring structures
	D. [[Amino Acids]] are monomers
		- Dehydration synthesis links them
		- Peptide bonds are unique to proteins
			a. Take carboxyl group of one amino acid and link it to amino group of another amino acid
			b. Releases water molecule in process
		- When you link amino acids in polymer chain, a single change can change structure, which greatly affects function
			a. Ex: If glutamic acid is swapped with valine, you get sickle [[Cell]] shape
				i. Don't go through capillaries well 
				ii. Don't transport oxygen well
II. Protein structures - four different structures
	A. Primary
		- Sequence of a chain of amino acids (linear)
		- Linear, sequential structure 
	B. Secondary
		- Two alternative shapes
			a. Alpha helix
			b. Beta sheet
		- Have NCC repeating for backbone
			a. Creates the backbone of peptide bonds
			b. Side chains are above the backbone or below the backbone
				i. Alternative above and below
				ii. Ex: Ones above are polar, ones below are nonpolar. Take beta sheet and form a tube. Polars are inside and nonpolar are outside. A protein biomolecule. Phospholipids make up membrane (hydrophobic outside and hydrophilic inside). Therefore, proteins can sit imbedded in the phospholipid membrane as a channel. Allows polar things to travel through membrane like a *tunnel*
					- Folding pattern of a protein due to side chain interactions
			c. Plane of the sheet is NCC repeating backbone
		- Hydrogen bonds determine shape ([[Chemical Bonds]])
			a. H bonds hold back together (repeating NCC)
			b. Make beta sheet or alpha helix
				i. Form because of hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone 
	C. Tertiary 
		- A proteins 3d, netted shape
		- Some side chains can form ionic bonds ([[Chemical Bonds]])
			a. Positive sides or negative sides 
		- Particular shape determined by variety of chemical interactions including hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, and disulfide linkages	
			a. Cystine's ([[Amino Acids]]) side chain ends in SH (thyal) (sulfhydryl) 
				i. Two cystines can form disulfide bonds or bridges (covalent)
				ii. Like a spot weld, hold and don't come apart
					~ H bonds can be broken if you change temp or pH, but covalent bonds do not change, so disulfide bonds are permanent 
					~ Disulfide bonds make it more stable
			a. Some side chains are non polar while others are polar
				i. Non polar side chains like to congregate and stay together
				ii. A protein can have a hydrophobic core when in aqueous solution {[[Water]]}
		- When you denature a protein, it can be a permanent or temporary change
			a. Ex: cooking egg whites creates a permanent change 
				i. Protein albumin has been permanently denatured
			b. Proteins with hydrophobic cores in [[Water]] solutions
				i. If you add more and more salt, the hydrophobic core may change and become more exposed. If you reduce the salt, it will fold into a hydrophobic core again
					~ Temporarily denatured
			c. We can isolate proteins by slightly modifying environment by pH ([[Acids and bases]]) or temperature
			d. Proteins that are specifically designed to help other proteins maintain their shape
				i. Called chaperon (heat shock (hsp)) proteins
				ii. Fixes other proteins' tertiary structures
		- Insulin
			a. Has an alpha and a beta chain, initially one single chain but separated and now disulfide bridges hold them together
			b. Must have correct structure to function
	D. Quintenary
		- Where two proteins interact and work together
			a. Must work together to function
III. Disulfide bonds
	a. Cystine's (amino acid) side chain ends in SH (thyal) (sulfhydryl) 
		i. Two cystines can form disulfide bonds or bridges (covalent)
		ii. Like a spot weld, hold and don't come apart
			~ H bonds can be broken if you change temp or pH, but covalent bonds do not change, so disulfide bonds are permanent
			~ Disulfide bonds make it more stable
	b. Proteins form disulfide bridges 
		i. Skunk spray has these and they can be very hard to remove
			~ Must break to remove smell

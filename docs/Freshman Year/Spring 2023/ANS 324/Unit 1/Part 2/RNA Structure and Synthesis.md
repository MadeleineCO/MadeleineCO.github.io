1. RNA = Ribonucleic acid
	1. Very similar to DNA but it has some differences, including. . .
		1. Uracil (U) instead of thymine (T)
			1. A-U and G-C
		2. Each nucleotide contains a different sugar
			1. Ribose in RNA instead of deoxyribose in DNA
		3. RNA is single-stranded and shorter than DNA
			4. RNA does not have any non-coding parts
		4. RNA is less stable than DNA
			1. Doesn't persist in the cell for long (sometimes it exists for just a few seconds)
			2. DNA can persist for the life of the cell
	2. Central Dogma
		1. DNA --> transcription to RNA -> translation to protein
		2. Three different RNA molecules are involved in protein synthesis: mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA
2. Transcription = RNA synthesis from DNA
	1. Occurs in the nucleus 
	2. mRNA carries the message about what type of protein should be made from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome
	3. The nucleotide sequences of RNA and DNA are the same (except uracil instead of thymine)
	4. mRNA is synthesized from DNA using base pairing
	5. Steps of Transcription
		1. Segment of DNA opens to create a transcription bubble
		2. *RNA polymerase* transcribes the complementary mRNA strand from the DNA template strand
			1. Runs in the 5'-3' direction
			2. The other strand of DNA is inactive and identical to the complementary mRNA strand from the template (except for Us vs Ts)
		3. The *promoter* sequence of DNA tells RNA polymerase which strand is to be copied
			1. RNA polymerase attaches at the promoter sequence of DNA, and it moves along the DNA, unzipping the strands 
				1. This allows for one mRNA molecule to be formed
			2. Uses a *TATA box* for the promoter sequence
		4. During transcription, a molecule of mRNA is formed as a complementary copy of a region on one strand of the DNA molecule

3. Once mRNA is formed, mRNA must go through processing stage
	1. Capping is the first modification to mRNA
		1. Addition of 7-methylguanosine cap on the 5' end
		2. Purpose is to prevent degradation, facilitate attachment to ribosomes, and improve stability of mRNA
	2. Addition of poly-A tail on the 3' end is the second modification
		1. Called polyadenylation
		2. Purpose is to signal the end of transcription and improve stability of mRNA
	3. Third modification is intron splicing
		1. Enzymes in the nucleus remove the *introns* (non-coding sequences) and leave the exons (coding sequences)
		2. Purpose is to facilitate nuclear export and facilitate attachment to ribosomes

	5. After these modifications, the mRNA is ready to leave the nucleus and attach to the small subunit of the ribosome

1. [[Energy]] for all life ultimately comes from photosynthesis
2. Equation
	$$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$$
	- Anabolic reaction
		1. Lower in energy to higher in [[Energy]]
	- Oxygen is generated as waste product while [[Carbohydrate|carbs]] are stored
3. Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs in the presence of oxygen
	- Cyanobacteria 
	- 7 groups of algae (algae are not plants)
	- All land plants use chloroplasts and phytoplankton use it in parts of the ocean
		1. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyl
4. Deep ocean creatures do not have access to sunlight
	- Chemoautotrophs generate energy from other sources than sunlight 
		1. Ex: hydrogen sulfide
5. Other organisms are heterotrophs
	- Herbivores eat plants and metabolize energy created and stored from photosynthesis
		1. Must eat a lot of plants because relatively low energy
	- Carnivores eat other [[Organism|organisms]]
		1. Don't need to eat on the scale of herbivores bc their prey contains much higher energy than plants
6. Plant vascular tissue for transportation
	- Xylem brings [[Water]] up from the roots
	- Phloem brings sugar down to the roots
7. How do you take CO2 and make a sugar?
	- Small carbon molecules are built up into a sugar
8. Chloroplast
	- Thylakoid membrane - internal membrane 
		1. Barrier just like in mitochondria
		2. Contains chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments
			- Pigments capture the [[Energy]]
			- Pigments clustered into photosystems
	-  ---
	- Granum
		1. Stacks of thylakoids 
	- Inner membrane and outer membrane ([[Plasma Membranes]])
	- ---
9. Stages of photosynthesis
	- Light-dependent reactions
		1. Requires light
		2. Ocurr in the thylaxoid membrane
		3. Makes [[ATP]] and reduces NADP+ to NADPH
			- NADP+ is a electron carrier and nucleotide similar to NAD+
		4. Converts light [[Energy]] into chemical energy
		5. Granum captures photons of light and makes ATP and NADPH
		6. The Calvin Cycle
			- Takes place in stroma
			- Uses energy derived from these compounds to make 3 carbon GA3P molecules and CO2
				1. The 3 C GA3P can be linked together to for different monosaccharides such as glucose, fructose, etc. 
			- See graphic!
				1. ---
	- Light-independent reactions (carbon fixation reactions)
		1. Does not require [[Light]]
		2. Uses [[ATP]] and NADPH to synthesize organic molecules from CO2
10. Photoautotrophs
	- Organisms that use light energy and inorganic carbon to produce organic materials
	- Capture energy from sun
11. [[Light]]
12. Pigments
	- Molecules that absorb [[Light]] energy in the visible range
	- Light is form of [[Energy]]
		1. Photon is a particle of light
			- A discrete bundle of energy
			- Energy content of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength of the light
				1. Violet photons have more energy than red photons
	- Photelectric effect
		1. The removal of ---
	- Absorption spectrum = ---
	- Two broad categories
		1. Chlorophylls
			- We see these as green
		2. Carotenoids
			- We see these as oranges or yellows or purples
			- Xanthophyl 
		3. Capture different photons of light
	- Either absorb or reflect [[Energy]]
		1. We see the color that it reflects
		2. Rest of colors that we don't see are absorbed
		3. Chlorophyll has a C and H tail
			- Nonpolar like membranes
			- Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and b-carotene are hydrophobic pigments found in thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll a and b are identical except for part on end that are responsible for different colors of leaves. B-carotene is responsible for orange color in carrots. Each pigment has a unique absorbance spectrum
		4. In deciduous trees, chlorophyll breaks down in leaves first and leaves turn to red or orange. Then carotenoids like xanthophyll degrade and leaf turns brown and dies
	- Structure of chlorophyll
		1. Porphyrin ring
			- Complex ring structure w/ alternating double and single bonds
			- Magnesium ion at the center of the ring
			- Hydrocarbon and hydrophobic
			- Photons excite electrons in the ring
				1. Electrons are shuttled away from the ring
		2. Chlorophyll a
			- Main pigment in plants and cyanobacteria
			- Only pigment that can act directly to convert light energy to chemical [[Energy]]
			- Absorbs violet-blue and red [[Light]]
		3. Chlorophyll b
			- Accessory pigment or secondary pigment absorbing light wavelengths that chlorophyll a does not absorb
	- Plants that grow in shade have adapted to low levels of [[Light]] by changing the relative concentrations of their chlorophyll pigments
13. Chloroplasts have two connected photosystems
	- Oxygenic photosynthesis
	- Photosystem II works first (P680)
		1. Can generate an oxidation potential high enough to oxidize [[Water]]
	- Photosystem I works second (P700)
		1. Functions like sulfur bacteria ([[Anaerobic Respiration]])
	- Working together, the two photosystems carry out a noncyclic transfer of electrons that is used to generate both [[ATP]] and NADPH
	- [[Light]] hits porphyrin ring, excites electrons, and electrons are passed along the rings to the reaction center. 
		1. Energized electrons used in reaction center
		2. Oxidized [[Water]] is just oxygen, which is the waste product
			- Water is spit in the reaction center
			- Creates hydrogen ions and oxygen
			- High [[Energy]] electrons that work their way from the 1st complex to the 2nd and 3rd complex
				1. Like mitochondria in respiration
		3. Photosynthesis II resembles the reaction center of purple bacteria
			- Core of 10 transmembrane protein subunits w/ electron transfer components and two P680 chlorophyll molecules
			- Reaction center differs from purple bacteria ([[Prokaryotic Cell]]) in that it also contains four manganese [[Atoms]]
				1. Essential for oxidation of [[Water]]
	- Photosynthesis II --> B6-f complex -- > Photosystem I
		1. Proton pump embedded in thylakoid membrane ([[Plasma Membranes]])
		2. Pumps H+ ions from splitting the water in Photosynthesis II
			- Creates a gradient
		3. Every time electrons transfer to different complex, lose a bit of [[Energy]]
		4. Photosystem I reaction center consists of a core transmembrane complex consisting of 12-14 protein subunits w/ two bound P700 chlorophyll molecules
		5. Photosystem I accepts an electron from plastocyanin into the "hole" created by exit of a light-energized electron 
		6. In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, [[Energy]] from sunlight extracts electrons from water. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces NADP+ to NADPH. The ETC moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. At the same time, splitting of [[Water]] adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the stroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma ([[ATP]] synthase uses this electrochemical gradient to make ATP)
			- Dam of H+ ions in high concentration 
			- Creating NADPH
				1. NADPH unique to plants and NADH unique to mitochondria (similar but different - [[Cellular Respiration]])
			- This is all *light-dependent*
				1. Prepares for second half of photosynthesis, which is *light independent*
				2. [[Light]] dependent reactions summary
					- Primary photoevent
						1. Photon of light is captured by a pigment molecule
					- Charge separation
						1. Energy transferred to reaction center and excited electron transferred to acceptor molecule
					- Electron transport
						1. Electrons move through carriers to reduce NADP+
					- Chemiosmosis
						1. Produces [[ATP]]
	- Carbon fixation ([[Light]]-independent reaction)
		1. Uses [[ATP]] and NADPH from light dependent reaction
			- When a plant actually makes the sugar, it doesn't need light
				1. Needs light to get ATP and NADPH, but not sugar
				2. Potatoes are roots full of starch sugars (don't get light directly, but leaves get light and generate ATP and NADPH that are transported to the tuber)
					- Then tuber produces and stores sugar
		2. Cyclic Photophosphorylation 
			- In sulfur bacteria, only one photosystem is used ([[Anaerobic Respiration]])
				1. Generates ATP via electron transport
				2. Anoxygenic photosynthesis (without oxygen)
				3. Excited electron passed to ETC 
					- Then generates a proton gradient for [[ATP]] synthesis
		3. See graphic of Calvin cycle
	- Systems summary
		1. Photosystem I transfers electrons ultimately to NADP+, producing NADPH
		2. Photosystem II oxidizes water to replace the electrons transferred to photosystem I
		3. 2 photosystems connected by cytochrome/ b6-f complex
	- Noncyclic phosphorylation
		1. Plants use photosystems II and I in series to produce both ATP and NADPH (Path of electrons not a circle);
		2. Photosystems replenished with electrons obtained by splitting water
	- The Calvin cycle
		1. [[Enzymes|Enzyme]] ([[Protein]]) called RuBisCo takes 3 CO2s and modifies them to create product
14. First products of photosynthesis are oxygen and H+ ions
	- Whenever there is oxygen present, other chemicals can become oxidized
		1. Loses energy
		2. Phospholipids have phosphate head and fatty acid (hydrocarbon) tail
			- Lots of oxygen inside the membrane 
			- Can have free radicals, which are very reactive and could take electrons from hydrocarbon tail, breaking it apart
			- Increases the fluidity of the [[Plasma Membranes|membrane]] with each broken tail, breaking down the barrier
		3. How do you prevent this from happening in plants?
			- Structure of leaf
				1. Upper layer Brick-like cells w/ chloroplast on top
					- Palacide layer
				2. On bottom layer, more open spaces
					- Spongy 
				3. Allows CO2 to go in and O2 to go out through openings called stomata
					- Stomate must open to allow CO2 and H2O to enter and O2 to be released to prevent free radical issues and gain resources for photosynthesis
					- Could lose [[Water]] through evaporation if open on a hot day
				4. How do we prevent this water problem?
			- Some plants have C3 synthesis
				1. Type we have looked at are confronted by this [[Water]] and oxygen problem
					- Plants that fix carbon by using only C3 photosynthesis (the Calvin cycle)
				2. Must release oxygen, but lose [[Water]] in the process
				3. Grow nicely in the shade to prevent water escaping. Wilt (lose turgor pressure) in the heat as water escapes through open stomata that release oxygen
			- Other plants have C4 and CAM photosynthesis to prevent this issue
				1. Add CO2 to PEP to form 4 carbon molecules
					- Use PEP as carboxylase
					- Greater affinity for CO2, no oxidase activity
				2. C4 is the spatial (spacing) solution to free radical/water escape problem
					- Spatial difference between where you fixate resources and where you generate oxygen
					- Seeds can indicate this type of photosynthesis
						1. Monocaut or dicaut 
						2. If dicaut, can evenly split into two halves and two seed leaves (like a bean)
						3. If monocaut, cannot be split evenly and has one seed leaf (like corn)
							- Some monocauts can grow very quickly (ex bamboo)
				3. CAM is the temporal (timing) solution to free radical/[[Water]] escape problem
					- Only open stomata at night when chances of evaporation are lower
					- Cacti use this variation light-independent reactions of photosynthesis to increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to conserve water and energy
						1. Some animals eat seeds and plants that only have sufficient water at night
					- Pineapples do this as well

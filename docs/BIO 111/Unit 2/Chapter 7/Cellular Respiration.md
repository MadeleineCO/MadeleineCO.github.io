1. Respiration
	1. Convert energy
	2. Autotrophs
		- Able to produce their own organic molecules through photosynthesis
		- Plants, sea anemone, etc.
	3. Heterotrophs
		- Live on organic compounds produced by other organisms
		- Fungi, animals, etc.
	4. ---
	5. Cellular respiration is a series of reactions
		- Oxidations = loss of electrons
			- Products lower in energy (exergonic)
		- Reduction = the reverse of oxidation
			- Products higher in energy (endergonic)
		- Dehydrogenations = lost electrons are accompanied by protons
			- A hydrogen atom is lost (1 electron, 1 proton)
2. Redox
	1. During redox reactions, electrons carry energy from one molecule to another
		- One thing gets oxidized (loses electron) and the other gets reduced (gains electron)
	2. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+)
		- Special dinucleotide than is an electron carrier
		- NAD+ accepts 2 electrons and 1 proton to become NADH
			- Reaction is reversible
		- NAD+ is oxidized form. NADH is reduced form
			- NADH has more energy (reduced the charge because it has another electron
			- NAD+ (lost electron and lower in energy, but more positive)
		- NADH has two hydrogen and HAD+ has one hydrogen

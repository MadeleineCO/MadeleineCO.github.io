Organisms can be classified based on how they ---::obtain energy (autotrophs = produce own organic molecules through photosynthesis) (heterotrophs = live on organic compounds produced by other organisms)
^1663371700916

Cellular respiration is a ---::series of reactions that extracts energy from organic molecules
^1663371700928

Oxidation::Loss of electrons; Products are lower in energy (exergonic) and more positively charged
^1663371700934

Reduction::Gaining electrons (reverse of oxidation); products higher in energy
^1663371700941

Dehydrogenations::Lost electrons are accompanied by protons (a H atom is lost (1 electron, 1 proton))
^1663371700947

Redox::During redox reactions, electrons carry energy from one molecule to another; One thing gets oxidized (loses electron) and the other gets reduced (gains electron)
^1663371700953

Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+)::An electron carrier; NAD+ accepts 2 electrons and 1 proton to become NADH; Reaction is reversible; Special dinucleotide that is an electron carrier
^1663371700960

NAD+ is --- and NADH is ---::oxidized; reduced; NADH has more energy (reduced charge and another electron) while NAD+ is lower in energy (lost electron and more positive)
^1663371700965

NADH has --- H and HAD+ has --- H::two; one
^1663371700971

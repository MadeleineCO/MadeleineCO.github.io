1. 3 C molecule called glycerol with fatty acids compose [[Lipid|lipids]]
	- Triglyceride (three fatty acids + glycerol)
		1. More energy in fats than in glucose
	- Fatty acids are converted to acetyl groups by Beta-oxidation
		1. Takes 2 C at a time from fatty acid tail to form acetyl groups that can be put into Krebs cycle ([[Aerobic Respiration]])
	- Oxygen-dependent process
2. Glycogen from the liver and muscles, hydrolyzed into glucose-1-phosphate, together w/ fats and proteins, can feed into catabolic pathways for carbs
	- [[Carbohydrate|Carbohydrates]] and some [[Amino Acids]] and glycerol enter glycolysis
	- Fatty acids and some amino acids enter Krebs cycle as acetyl groups

1. [[The Genetic Material]]
	- [[DNA]] is a [[Nucleic Acid]]
		1. Building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, each composed of 5 carbon sugar called deoxyribose, a phosphate group (PO4), a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine)
	- When you make [[ATP]], phosphates make it unstable and it cannot be stored for long. Phosphates negatively charged.
	- [[DNA]] vs RNA
		1. RNA has hydroxyl group and degrade very quickly
		2. [[DNA]] does not have hydroxyl group (deoxyribose) and can stay around for ages
	- Double ring structure = purines and single ring structure = pyrimidines
	- Nucleotides consist of nitrogenous base at 1' carbon, a phosphate group (-PO4) at 5' carbon, and hydroxyl group (-OH) at 3' carbon
	- Front end is 5' and back end is 3'
	- Repetitive sequence of ribose sugar and phosphate for backbone
		1. When you create these long chains, you bring in next nucleotide to 3' end where there is available phosphate
		2. Creates phosphodiester bond between 5' phosphate of one nucleotide and 3' hydroxyl of next nucleotide
		3. Each chain of nucleotides has 5' to 3' orientation
	- History of [[DNA]] structure research
		1. Scientists used to believe DNA was junk material. Focused more on protein action.
		2. Determining the 3d structure of [[DNA]] involved work of many scientists
			- Erwin Chargaff determined that. . .
				1. Amount of adenine = amount of thymine
				2. Amount of cytosine = amount of guanine
				3. Known as "Chargaff's Rules"
			- Rosalind Franklin's and Maurice Wilkin's X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that. . .
				1. [[DNA]] is helical
				2. Diameter of 2 nm
				3. Makes a complete turn every 3.4 nm
				4. X-ray diffraction
					- Crystals have very regular, predictable structure
					- Rosalind Franklin made a crystal of [[DNA]]
					- If you have crystal, you can shoot x-ray beam through the crystal. 
					- [[Atoms]] made up of [[Electrons]] and nucleus w/ protons and neutrons. Mass is in nucleus and a little in [[Electrons]]. Space in between. If x-ray beam hits the nucleus straight on, then it will bounce straight back. If it hits side of nucleus or electron, it will be deflected. However, if it goes through empty space, it will not collide w/ any part of the atom.
					- You can shoot x-ray beam then a detector shows how beam is deflected. Rosalind Franklin did this. Darkest areas indicate areas where a lot of x-ray beams went to same spot. Could happen if deflecting off same spots. Rosalind used this information and the predictability of DNA crystal to measure distances and shape of [[DNA]].
			- James Watson and Francis Crick (1953)
				1. One of most significant scientific advances of 20th century
				2. Wanted to build a model and fit pieces of earlier discoveries together
					- Deduced structure of [[DNA]] using evidence from Chargaff, Franklin, and others
				3. Tried different pairs of nucleotides w/ scale of 2 nm diameter
					- A to A did not equal 2 nm
					- A to T worked.
					- (*The double helix* book)
				4. First tried 5' to 5 and 3' to 3' but this didn't work. Then tried double helix where 5' corresponds to 3'
					- When structure is known, we can deduce function
					- Led to questions such as how is [[DNA]] read?
2. Critical things to remember
	- [[DNA]] is 2 nm in diameter
	- 2 sugar phosphate backbones
	- Bases toward the interior of one strand form H bonds w/ complimentary bases on the opposite strand
	- Antiparallel strands - one oriented 5' to 3' (top to bottom) and other 3' to 5' (bottom to top)
		1. Strands wrap around each other to create the double helix
	- [[Protein|Proteins]] can bind into major grooves on DNA, bending it and changing the diameter

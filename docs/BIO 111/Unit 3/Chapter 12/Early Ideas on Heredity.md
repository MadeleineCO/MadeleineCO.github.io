1. [[Genetics and Heredity]]
	- In the 1900s, 2 concepts were the basis for ideas about heredity
		1. Heredity occurs within species
		2. Traits are transmitted directly from both parents to offspring
		3. This led to belief that inheritance is a blending of parental traits
	- Early botanists produced hybrids (crosses between two true-breeding plants)
		1. Crossing can create a new version that's different from originals
		2. If you cross plants w/ same traits then you get offspring w/ same traits (true-breeding)
		3. Hybrids cross various traits from true-breeders
		4. When hybrids are crossed, some offspring resembled the original strains rather than the hybrid parents
			- The hybrids were not true-breeding
			- Contradicted the idea that inherited traits are always a blending of parental traits 
		3. Gregor Mendel - mid 1800s
			- Studied pea plants because. . .
				1. Hybrids could be produced
				2. Many varieties were available
				3. Small and easy to grow
				4. Can self-fertilize or cross-fertilize
					- A plant has both male and female gamete producing tissues
					- A plant that self-fertilizes creates a true-breeder
				5. Mendel's Methods
					- Produced true-breeding strains form any traits
					- Crossed true-breeding strains w/ alternate forms of a trait to produce hybrids
					- Preformed reciprocal crosses where each plant serves alternatively as a "mother" and a "father"
					- Allowed the hybrids to self-fertilize and counted the number of offspring showing each form of the trait
					- Mendel produced true-breeding pea strains for 7 different traits, each trait w/ 2 alternate forms (variations)
						1. Then produced hybrids by pollination
						2. ---
					- Monohybrid crosses
						1. Studied 2 forms of a single trait
						2. Mendel hybridized the 2 true-breeding strains for each trait
						3. Breed violet flowers w/ white flowers
							- This created a violet flower
							- Then self-fertilized the hybrids
							- Created 705 violet flowers and 224 white flowers
								1. About 3 to 1 ratio
						4. Consistent pattern w/ one trait disappearing then showing up in following combination
						5. ---
						6. Dominant = The form of each trait seen in the F1 plants (ex violet flower color)
						7. Recessive = The form of the trait that "disappeared" in the F1 plants (ex white flower color)
						8. F2 generation = Offspring resulting from the self-fertilization of F1 plants (F1 x F1 = F2)
							- F2 plants exhibited both forms of the trait
							- 3/4 of the plants had dominant form
							- 1/4 of plants had recessive form
							- 3:1 ratio
						9. By producing F3 plants, Mendel discovered the ratio is actually 1:2:1 
							- 25% true-breeding dominant plants
							- 50% not-true-breeding dominant plants
							- 25% true-breeding recessive plants
							- Parent generation (two true-breeding strains) --> F1 (100% dominant but not true-breeding) --> F2 (3:1 ratio) --> F3 (1:2:1)
		- Explanation for Mendel's results
			1. Gene = genetic instructions for one polypeptide chain (protein or quaternary protein interactions)
				- Section of chromosome that codes for a particular trait
			2. Alleles = Alternate forms of genes that occur on homologous chromosomes
				- Dominant or Recessive versions
				- Gets one allele from father and one from mother
			3. Homozygous = Having all of the same allele
				- Ex: AA, aa
			4. Heterozygous = Having different alleles (got different alleles from mother and father)
				- Ex: Aa
			5. Genotype = the alleles carried by an individual
				- RR = homozygous dominant (can produce only R gametes)
				- Rr = heterozygous (can produce both R and r gametes)
				- rr = homozygous recessive (can produce only r gametes)
			6. Phenotype: outward appearance = the result of many different genes, interactions among those genes, and environmental effects.

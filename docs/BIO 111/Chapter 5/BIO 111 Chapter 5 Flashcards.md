Charged phosphate is ---::hydrophilic (all charged molecules = hydrophilic); Causes phospholipids to cluster with hydrophobic tails and hydrophobic fatty acid/glycerol heads
^1662742656455

Membrane structure::Highly organized; Phospholipids arranged in a bilayer; Globular proteins inserted in the lipid bilayer
^1662747059415

Fluid mosaic model::Mosaic of proteins, phospholipids, and cholesterol floats in or on the fluid lipid bilayer like boats on a pond; Can restrict movement w/ tight junctions but overall not rigid
^1662747059425

Phospholipid bilayer::Flexible matrix and barrier to permeability; Phospholipids cluster w/ hydrophobic tails from charged phosphate and attached amino acid (serine); 2 fatty acids attached to glycerol (hydrophobic)
^1662747059431

4 component's of cellular membranes::Phospholipid bilayer, Transmembrane proteins, Interior protein network, Cell surface markers
^1662747059438

Transmembrane proteins::Integral membrane proteins; Work across the membrane; Made up of beta sheet proteins for tunnels or alpha helix proteins with parts inside and parts outside
^1662747059444

Interior protein network::Peripheral membrane proteins; Only work on inside of membrane
^1662747059449

Cell surface markers::Made up of glycoproteins and glycolipids (sugar  + protein OR lipid); How body recognizes foreign substances; In plasma membrane
^1662747059455

Transplant patients must have identical ---:: cell surface markers for success
^1662747059461

The plasma membrane can make cells more rigid or vise versa regulated by ---::cholesterol (more cholesterol = more rigid and vise versa)
^1662747059467

Glycoprotein::Protein with carb attached; Extends from plasma membranes
^1662747059473

Glycolipid::Lipid with carb attached; Extends from plasma membrane
^1662747059479

Peripheral membrane proteins, integral membrane proteins, protein channels, cytoskeletal filaments, cholesterol, glycoproteins, and glycolipids make up ---::plasma membranes
^1662747059486

Phospholipid structure consists of ---::Glycerol (3 carbon polyalcohol), 2 fatty acids attached to glycerol (hydrophobic), and phosphate group attached to the glycerol (hydrophilic); Creates a bilayer w/ fatty acids on inside and phosphate groups on both external surfaces
^1662747059491

Phospholipid molecule is composed of a --- head and two --- tails::hydrophilic; hydrophobic; The head group consists of phosphate-containing group attached to a glycerol molecule; The tails contain either sat or unsat fatty acid and are long hydrocarbon chains
^1662747059497

In an aqueous solution, phospholipids arrange themselves with their --- heads facing outward and their --- tails facing inward::polar; hydrophobic
^1662747059503

Cholesterol has ONLY ---::C and H; Makes it nonpolar and very hydrophobic
^1662747059509

Cholesterol can be converted into ---::hormones; Sex - testosterone and estrogen; Removes hydrophobic tail and has same ring structure but two different structures; Estrogen must be converted from testosterone
^1662747059515

Nitrogen is in all --- and ---::amino acids; nucleotides
^1662747059521

Cholesterol cannot diffuse through membrane, so how does it get inside cell?::Two transport proteins (LDL - low density lipoprotein) and (HDL - high density lipoprotein); LDL tends to build up in bloodstream, so worse for you
^1662747059527

Glycolipids can be embedded in ---::membrane bc of hydrocarbon tails
^1662747059532

Membrane proteins have various ---::functions (transporters, enzymes, cell-surface receptors, cell-surface identity markers, cell-to-cell adhesion proteins; attachments to the cytoskeleton)
^1662747059539

Transporter proteins::Proteins can create channels for hydrophobic molecules through plasma membrane
^1662747059545

Enzymes::Can work to speed up reactions (catalysts)
^1662747059551

Cell surface receptors::Used for communication
^1662747059557

Cell surface identity makers::Mark cells as like or foreign; Used for immune system identification
^1662747059563

Cell to cell adhesion proteins::Form junctions
^1662747059570

Proteins can serve as attachments to the ---::cytoskeleton
^1662747059576

Integral membrane proteins ---::span the lipid bilayer (transmembrane proteins); Nonpolar regions are embedded in interior of bilayer while polar regions protrude from both sides
^1662747059582

Transmembrane protein domain::Spans the lipid bilayer; Hydrophobic amino acids arranged in a helices; Can be a helix or beta sheet
^1662747059588

Single pass transmembrane protein::Can go through membrane once; Front = N terminal (outside) and back = C terminal (inside of cell)
^1662747059594

Triple pass proteins::Can go through membrane three times; Weaves back and forth from outside to inside of cell
^1662747059600

Beta sheet protein::N terminal and C terminal are on the same side; Spans the membrane
^1662747059605

Membrane associated protein::Weaves through half of membrane with terminals on same side
^1662747059611

Lipid linked protein::Cytosol, Cooh, NH2, Main part of protein weaves on the outside or inside of cell and has small portion linking to hydrophobic interior of membrane
^1662747059618

Protein attached::Quaternary structure (protein to protein interaction); One protein outside of membrane the other weaving through the membrane to other side
^1662747059624

HIV binds to CD4 receptor, a ---::glycoprotein on the surfaces of T cells; Brought in by endocytosis as the 7 pass transmembrane proteins are activated by the virus. A vesicle forms w/ virus inside and allows it to fuse w/ lysosome to release virus to the rest of the cell; This is also how cholesterol gets inside cells
^1662747059630

Passive transport::Movement of molecules through the membrane w/out using energy; Response to concentration gradient (diffusion from high concentration to low concentration)
^1662747059636

Major barrier to crossing membrane is the ---::hydrophobic interior that repels polar molecules but not nonpolar molecules (move until concentration is equal on both sides)
^1662747059641

The plasma membrane has limited permeability to ---::small polar molecules and very limited to larger polar molecules and ions
^1662747059647

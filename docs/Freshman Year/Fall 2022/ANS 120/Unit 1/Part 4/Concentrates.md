1. Two types of concentrates (energy and protein)
	1. [[Nutrition - Energy|Energy]] concentrates
		- Plant sources (grains)
		- Examples of energy concentrates 
			- Seeds
				1. Corn
					1. Has relatively high energy 
						- More starch/endosperm
						- Smaller seed coat
				2. Wheat
				3. Barley
				4. Milo
				5. Oats
		- A kernel of wheat contains. . .
			- Endosperm = carb that helps plant survive until it is large enough to have leaves, roots, photosynthesis, etc.
				1. Starch ([[ANS Carbohydrates]])
			- Bran = outside seed coat made of cellulose
			- Germ = for reproduction; embryo of the seed
		- Processing increases the digestibility of grains
			- Allows us to access more energy by breaking the seed coat and grinding it
				1. Grinding too much decreases palpability (ex flour) but more ground means more digestible
				1. Exposes the inside of grain to chemical or microbial digestion ([[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]])
			- Seeds coat designed to not be digestible so that they are expelled in feces and spread
				1. Processing allows us to access nutrients inside
			- Also increases the surface area of feed
				1. Gives more places for chemicals or microbes to break it down
	1. [[Nutrition - Protein]] concentrates
		1. Animal sources
			- By-products of processing things for people
			- Skin, bones, head, tail, bone, etc. is ground, cooked, and mixed
				- Ex: meat and bone meal, fish meal, blood meal (usually from cows)
					- Blood meal is almost all protein
			- Generally 60% to 90% pure protein
		1. Plant sources
			1. Ex: cottonseed, soybeans, linseed
				- In soybean meal, we completely remove seed coat and grind inside
				- Cottonseed is by-product is cotton
					- Contains gossypol, which as a natural insecticide and neurotoxin
						1. Dangerous for [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]] (in [[Ruminant|ruminants]], microbes can remove neurotoxin)
						2. We cook or heat it to remove neurotoxin, removing the seed coat, and grind inside
		1. CP is greater than 35%
		2. [[Nutrition - Protein|Protein]] is needed for growth and development
			- Required for muscles, ligaments, etc.
			- We add it to feed to help animals grow strong

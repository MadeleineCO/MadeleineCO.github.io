1. Darwin looked at other scientist's work
	1. They set the foundation
2. Many scientists influences Darwin
	1. Most were staunch creationists
	2. Ascribed to fixity of species
		1. *Scala naturae* --> Rungs of ladder
		2. Differ by complexity; perfect as is
	3. Observation & research changed
3. Georges-Louis Leclerc
	1. 18th Naturalist
	2. Posited evidence of evolution
	3. Studied environmental and survival struggle
	4. Was never all in
		1. Not really beyond a thought experiment
4. Carl Linnaeus
	1. 18th Physician & Botanist
	2. Binomial nomenclature
		1. Naming scheme w/ genus + species
		2. *Amia calua* = bowfin fish
	3. Hierarchical classification
		2. DKPCOFGS
			1. Domain
			2. Kingdom
			3. Phylum
			4. Class
			5. Order
			6. Family
			7. Genus 
			8. Species
		3. From inclusive to exclusive
	4. Accepted fixity and creation
5. Baron George Cuvier
	1. Late 18th century zoologist
	2. Accepted fixity of species
	3. Created paleontolgy
		1. Study of prehistoric life
	4. Comparative anatomy & fossils
	5. First to suggest organism extinction
	6. Strata & fossils --> things changed
		1. Strata = layers of soil
			1. Stratum
	7. Catastrophism
		1. Catastrophic events that wipe out animals
6. James Hutton & Charles Lyell
	1. Prominent geologists 
	2. Uniformitarianism
		1. H; Slow & continuous changes in past
		2. L; Slow & continuous changes now
		3. L; *Principles of Geology* (1830)
	3. Still accepted today
	4. Rates of change vary
		1. Both in past and now
	5. Ex: glacial movement
7. Thomas Malthus
	1. 18th century economist
	2. *An Essay on the Principle of Population*
	3. Studied human demography
	4. Population size influenced by...
		1. Food, water, and shelter
		2. Famine, war, and epidemics
		3. Called carrying capacity
			1. How large of a population can the environment sustain?
	5. Overstretched population
		1. When you reach carrying capacity, problems happen such as famine
8. Jean-Baptist de Lamarck
	1. Late 18th century biologist
	2. 1st testable hypothesis of evolution
	3. Inheritance of acquired traits
		1. Less complex --> More complex
		2. Environment --> physical changes
		3. Does not infer genetic change
			1. Different process than Darwin (who comes later)
	4. Ex: Giraffes and their long necks
9. Charles Darwin & Alfred Wallace
	1. Darwin's early career
		1. 19th century naturalist
		2. Staunch creationist to start
		3. Worked in geology & botany
	2. Darwin's famous trip
		1. Travelled aboard *HMS Beagle*
		2. Travelled to the Southern hemisphere
		3. Took 5 yrs
		4. Observed many phenomena
			1. Geological change
			2. Fossils and extinction
			3. Earth was older than thought
		5. Enough time --> Modification
	3. Alfred Wallace
		1. 19th century naturalist
		2. Similar theory to Darwin's 
		3. Studied the Malay Archipelago
		4. Sent his paper to Darwin first
			1. Encouraged Darwin to speed up his work so he could be first
	4. Darwin's Voyage Aboard the *HMS Beagle*
		1. Darwin meant to be company for the captain
			1. Not aboard to be a naturalist
		2. Made many observations
			1. Geographic distribution of organisms
				1. Incremental geological changes
				2. Present day informs about past
			2. Adaptions & Environment
				1. Cavy (SA) similar to Rabbit (EU)
				2. Greater vs. Lesser Rhea
			3. Galapagos Islands
				1. Mainland too far for colonization
				2. Darwin observed remarkable diversity & unity
				3. Darwin's ground finches
					1. Gould later ID'd the birds as "Ground finches"
					2. All had different beaks
					3. Different forms --> Different niches
						1. Big beak = smashing seeds
						2. Small beak = better at catching insects
					4. New species relative to EU finches
					5. Derived from one SA ancestor
				4. Tortoises
10. LaMarck vs. Darwin
	1. Hypothesis linked to giraffe evolution
	2. LaMarck believed in *Inheritance of acquired traits*
		1. Short necked giraffes --> giraffes "lengthen" necks
		2. Long-necked giraffes created
		3. Passed onto subsequent generations
		4. Phenotype changed genotype?
	3. Darwin believed in *decent w/ modification*
		1. Giraffe population was variable
		2. Short and long-necked giraffes existed
		3. Long-necked giraffes outcompeted
			1. More long-necked offspring
			2. More long-necked genes in population
			3. Short-necked eventually disappear
			4. Left w/ just long-necked giraffes
		4. Genetics were in population before and long-necked genes dominated bc more successful

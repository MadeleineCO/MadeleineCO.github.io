1. The Holy Trinity = the distinctive Christian understanding of God
	1. "When I say God, I mean Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" - Gregory of Nazianzus
2. Biblical Basis
	1. Bible as unfolding narrative and progressive revelation
		1. Implies trinitarian conception of God
		2. implications can be more deeply held than explications because they lie under/come before what is explicit
			1. Assumed/presumed
	2. Old Testament
		1. YHWH = single, personal agent (conceptually) but the name itself is cryptic and open-ended
			1. Does not rule out personal plurality
			2. Oneness: Deuteronomy 6:4 = YHWH's uniqueness as Creator and Sovereign Lord, which means no other "gods" but this God
				1. Not reference to singularity of being or persons
		2. Elohim = plural
			1. Gen 2:33, 11:7
			2. "Theophanies" = Jesus appearing in differentiated bodily form 
		3. OT notions of Spirit, Wisdom, and Word (personified)
			1. Suggestive of some kind of differentiation of being
			2. NT identifies these as Holy Spirit and Jesus
			3. OT focus on transcendence
				1. High king over all
				2. Divine immanence = communicate via Spirit, wisdom, word
					1. Jesus is wisdom and word personified
			4. Jewish monotheism is less rigid/concrete than that of Islam
				1. More dynamic "God"
		4. New Testament
			1. "Trinity" becomes more clear/explicit in claims of Jesus and NT interpretation of his person and work
			2. Jesus's humanity is assumed
				1. Deity revealed
				2. John's gospel is most clear on this
			3. Jesus's Divinity
				1. Titles -> God (Theos) = 8 times
					1. Son of Man - Coming judge, King over all
						1. Reference to Dan 7
					2. Son of God - Royal; Called the "only begotten Son"
					3. Lord associated w/ Jesus
				2. Functions - creator
					1. Recreation (2 Cor 5:17, Hebrews 1:3, John 1:3)
					2. Judgement (Mat 25:31)
					3. Salvation 
					4. Forgiveness (Luke 7:48, Mark 2:1-12)
					5. Resurrection (John 5:25-29)
				3. Worshipped w/ the Father explicitly in the Bible
					1. Doxologies that bring Jesus and the Father together
						1. John's Gospel establishes special relationship between Father and Son, showing personal distinction and divine equality
					2. Prayers to Jesus (Acts 7:59-60, 1 Cor 16:22, 2 Cor 12:8)
				4. Holy Spirit personalization deepened in the NT
					1. Active in creation, regeneration, sanctification, judgment, speaks, is lied to, grieves
					2. Described as "another advocate" = paraclete (John 16:16-17)
						1. Distinguishes his personhood
3. Triadic formulae
	1. Name is singular
	2. Neither can be reduced to the other
	3. God's movement in creation and redemption is "from the Father, through the Son, in the power of the Spirit"
		1. While our response to God is, conversely, in the power of the Spirit, through the Son, to the Father
4. Historical development
	1. Apostolic Fathers - nothing beyond NT
	2. Apologists (late 2nd century) - use logos concept to gain respectability and appreciation for the coherence of a triune God
		1. Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130-200)
			1. Son and Spirit as "two hands of the Father"
			2. Economic triunity = divine roles as revealed in history
			3. Ontological triunity ("immanent trinity") = God's eternal being in God-self
		2. Tertullian (c. 160-220)
			1. Coins "trinities" and "persona" uses "person" to distinguish the three contra "Modalism"
			2. Distinct, not divided
				1. Like a royal monarchy
					1. King and prince
			3. "Substantic" - used substance to refer to this unity
	3. Arian controversy (4th century)
		1. Arius (250-336) vs. Athenasins (295-373)
			1. Name after Arius (church leader)
			2. Athenasins position
				1. Son was somehow subordinate to the Father
				2. May have existed before the incarnation but not eternal
				3. Jesus the first creation of God
			3. Council of Nicea rejected Athenasins' position
				1. Declared Christ as "homousians" (of the same essence as Father)

			1. John of Damascus - the Orthodox Faith (8th century)
	5. Augustine = Father of Western Doctrine on the Trinity
		1. Committed to divine simplicity (Neoplatonic background)
			1. Allows only one essential "thing" in God
		2. Like "substance" but not "persona"
		3. Psychological analogy
			1. Like Imago Dei - the rational soul, mind, knowledge, or memory, understanding, will-as being, like the trinity
			2. Lover analogy - Lover, Beloved, Bond of love
	6. Richard of St. Victor (d. 1173)
		1. "God is love"
			1. Requires love
	7. Thomas Aquinas
		1. Picks up and develops Augustine's view (subsistent relations = triunity)
		2. Becomes standard for western theological thought
5. Modern demise of Trinity doctrine
	1. Enlightenment -> human reason and autonomy
		1. Led to Atheism, Deism, and Unitarianism
			1. Reduces Jesus to human teacher/moral examples
		2. Kant - "no practical relevance at all"

		1. Church dogmatics 
		2. Restored "revelation" to prominence
		3. Elevated Trinity to the interpretive key for all Christian theology

		1. Began reprioritizing the biblical narrative over traditional philosophical perspectives (absolute Being or Supreme Substance)
7. Author's proposal - orthodoxy, coherence, relevance
	1. Key question - divine personhood, what is a "person"?
		1. "A person constitutes a center of thought, will, act, love, and therefore consciousness"
	2. Options
		1. One person, existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
			1. Modalism = Trinitarian heresy
		2. Three Persons (F, S, HS) who are also One Person
		3. Three Persons (F, S, HS) who together are one true God
			1. Authors argue for option 3
			2. "Social Trinity"
				1. Essential divine unity - homoousios
					1. Same sort of essence, shared in common
				2. Quasi-genetic unity - family bond
				3. Perichoretic unity - united in purpose, fellowship, love
				4. Mystery
				5. Practical relevance = transcendence and imminence
					1. Model for human community = more socially conscious and communal spirituality
	3. Creedal parameters/foul lines for Trinitarian orthodoxy
		1. Athanasian Creed
			1. Cannot "confuse the persons"
				1. Like in modalism
			2. Cannot "divide the essence"

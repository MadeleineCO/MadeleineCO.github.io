1. Lab 1
	1. Understand the film
		1. Charles Darwin's life
			1. Who was he?
			2. Where did he go?
			3. When did this happen?
			4. Why was he important?
		2. Tree of life
	2. The geological timescale
		1. 4.6 meter long string
			1. Each meter = 1 bil yrs
		2. Visualizing time
		3. Look at major events
			1. Formation of Earth 
			2. First evidence of life (prokaryotic)
			3. Eukaryotic life
			4. Animal life
			5. Human life
2. Lab 2
	1. Great Transformations
		1. Valley of the whales
			1. What were they looking for?
			2. What did they find?
				1. Fossils of land-dwelling animal that likely went back into the water
			3. How did whale evolution occur?
		2. Work w/ fruit flies
			1. How does embryonic development occur?
			2. Standard recipe?
				1. Control genes
				2. Took genes from one animal and inserted it into another
					1. And it worked!
		3. Fossil digging in PA
			1. Found fossils related to the Cambrian explosion
				1. Burst of animal life
	2. Beak of the Finch
		1. Husband + Wife that worked in 1970s on Daphnea Major on the GI
		2. Studied birds
			1. Times of drought vs times of high precipitation
			2. How did env affect bird beak size?
				1. Rain = small seeds favored = smaller beaks favored
				2. Drought = large seeds favored = larger beaks favored
		3. Microevolution
			1. Evolution within one bird - the ground finch
			2. If this occurs enough, separate spp may arise
3. Lab 3
	1. Malaria and SCA
		1. What are those diseases?
			1. SCA is a *genetic* disease
				1. Homo rec disease
			2. Malaria is carried by mosquitoes
				1. Not a genetic disease, a parasitic disease
	2. Modeled populations 
		1. In warm, wet areas, more mosquitoes and more malaria 
			1. SCA and malaria are related due to hetero advantage
			2. AS protects against mosquito
		2. Fitness depends on location
			1. Dry = normal phenotype is best (AA or AS)
			2. Wet = AS genotype is best
			3. SS is never ideal
	3. Mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, small pops, selection
		1. These can all change genotypic and allelic frequencies
		2. Act as evolutionary agents
	4. HW Problems
		1.

SCA creates --- instead of disks::crescents; Caused by a single nucleotide change in the hemoglobin protein gene of DNA; RBCs meant to carry oxygen (needed for ATP) and normally round and concaved to maximize oxygen carrying potential; In SCA, doesn't carry enough oxygen and get stuck more easily
^1674683940652

SCA didn't disappear in the gene pool through ---::natural selection; Very prevalent, especially in moist areas of Africa; Carriers are protected against malaria so selection against both AA and SS in malaria environments (heterozygote advantage)
^1674683940659

Allele::A variation of a gene (A or a); Different possibilities that you could have for a gene; One from mother and one from father
^1674683940665

Locus::A spot on a chromosome; The location of a gene
^1674683940671

Homozygous genotype::Same alleles (AA or aa)
^1674683940678

Heterozygous genotype::Different alleles (Aa)
^1674683940683

Malaria is caused by a parasite that lives in the blood of ---::mosquitos (the vector)
^1674683940689

Allelic frequencies::The percentage of A and S in SCA example; p + q = 1; Ex: in area w/ malaria, most people are hetero (about .50 + .50 = 1)
^1674683940695

Genotypic frequencies::The percentage of AA, AS, or SS in SCA example; p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1
^1674683940701

The probability of dying from malaria is greater in the regions of Africa w/ ---::high annual precipitation (bc that's where most mosquitoes live); Consequently, precipitation correlates w/ presence of S allele
^1674696043625

Certain genotypes are associated w/ higher or lower ---, and the relationship between genotypes and --- depends on the local env::fitness (fitness describes how successful an individual is at passing on his or her genes to future generations); Fitness is related to survival and repro ability
^1674696043639

What are the requirements for evolution by natural selection?::For a given pop and trait, it can only occur if all three of the following conditions apply: variation (different versions of trait must exist in pop), heritability (differences must be passed from parent to offspring), and differential fitness (differences must affect how individuals may survive and reproduce (fitness))
^1674696043646

Suppose an entire pop in a very wet region of Africa escaped mosquitoes by moving to an unpopulated area in a dry region. How would the move change the people's fitness?::On avg, the relative fitness of AS heterozygotes would decrease bc protection against malaria would no longer be advantageous 
^1674696043654

Hetero advantage occurs when the hetero genotype for a particular gene confers ---::higher fitness than do homo genotypes
^1674696043661

New alleles can result from ---::random mutations in DNA; These alleles can spread when the people who inherited the allele migrate to new areas where the allele proliferates (gene flow)
^1674696043669

Genetic Drift::The fluctuation of allele frequencies produced by random events; Natural selection and genetic drift are primary forces in underlying shifts of allele frequencies over time in populations (not mutually exclusive - strong selection can overcome random factors but when selection is weak, genetic drift may dominate)
^1674696043676

Genetic drift is the result of ---::random events; Larger populations are more buffered from genetic drift than smaller ones
^1674696043683

Genetic drift is governed by ---::chance and probability; The probability of an occurrence depends on its frequency; The probability of two events is equal to the probability of the first event multiplied by the probability of the second event
^1674696043690

In small populations, just by chance, a particular allele's frequency is more likely to become ---::fixed and either disappear entirely or become the only allele circulating in the pop; In large populations, allele frequencies tend to remain relatively stable over time
^1674696043698

Hardy and Weinberg showed mathematically that allele frequencies will remain constant when --- conditions are true::five (no natural selection, no genetic drift, no mutation, no migration, random mating)
^1674696043706

When the five HWE conditions are met, this equation can be used::p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 where p = dom allele and q = rec allele; This equation shows the genotypic frequencies; p + q = 1 shows the allelic frequencies 
^1674696043714

The HW equation is often used as a ---::null model (a simplified version of a system in which nothing significant is occurring); Like the null hypothesis to evolution

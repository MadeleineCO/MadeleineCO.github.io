1. Sex Classes - Chicken
	- Mature male = rooster/cock
	- Mature female = hen
	- Castrated male = capon
	- Immature male = cockrel
	- Immature female = pullet
	- Offspring = chick
2. [[Avian|Avians]] ([[Domestication]] and Breeds)
3. Production
	- Most turkey produced in North Carolina and Minnesota 
		1. Turkey consumption has increased
		2. Still eat more chicken than turkey
	- World poultry meat production increasing 
	- GA is number 1 broiler production
		1. Broilers centralized in southeast
	- Vertical integration in broiler industry
		1. Infrastructure = production steps
			- Vertical integration = ownership or control of more than one step in production process
		2. When one company owns every step of the process
			- Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Wayne Farms, etc. 
		3. See infrastructure graph ---
4. Types of meat birds
	- Ancestor = Asian Jungle Fowl
		1. Relatively small (4-6 lbs in 3+ years)
		2. Broiler reaches 4-5 lbs in 35-45 days
	- Must have breeding facility for eggs (hatchery)
		1. Laying hen facilities w/ nest boxes and roosters 
		2. Eggs go into incubators w/ right temp and rotation
		3. Sexing chicks by looking at wing feathers
			- If uneven rows of covert feathers, its a pullet. If rows are even, its a cockrel.
			- May also be able to sex by vent anatomy
		4. Can then ship chicks (fine up till a week bc of yoke rudiments)
	- Transferred to broiler houses (Grower)
		1. Privately owned but contracted by large companies
		2. Process call *all in all out* (bring chicks in all at one time then move them out all at one time)
		3. Climate control
		4. Pulley system for feed and waters to facilitate movement of birds
		5. Come in at 1-3 days old then removed at 35-50 days post-hatching
		6. Have heater
		7. Yolk sac provides nutrients for first couple days
		8. Typically moved at night bc they are calmer
		9. Then clean litter (usually sawdust) and sanitize before starting over
		10. See timeline
5. Egg production
	- Ancestor = Asian jungle fowl
		1. Produces 4-10 eggs per year
		2. Now we have white leghorn that produces 290/year
	- Birds are almost like long day breeders
		1. Longer day = more eggs in nature
	- Asia produces by far most eggs
		1. GA is number 6 producer in US
		2. ---
		3. Gone from 260 to about 300 eggs per year
			- Optimizing environment
	- Egg consumption going up in US
		1. Avian influenza has killed some birds more recently so slight drop (more expensive)
	- Vertical Integration
		1. Ownership of more than one step
		2. Similar to broiler in that few companies involved
		3. See graph
	- Egg laying birds are started similar way to broilers
		1. Moved to grower 1-3 days post hatching
		2. Instead of there 30 days, stay 18-22 weeks (about 6 months)
		3. Much lower density
		4. Stay there until they start laying
	- Most common production systems
		1. Battery cages (conventional method)
			- About 70%
			- Rows of cages w/ slanted floor
			- Conveyor belts for eggs and fecal matter
				1. Keeps waste away from animal
			- Automatic waters and automatic feeders
			- We control temp and humidity
				1. For about a year, mimics long day
				2. Environmental control
			- 8-10 birds per cage
		2. Cage free (not in cages)
			- About 30%
			- Indoors
			- Have nest boxes
				1. Facilitates egg collection
			- Access to floor and roosting area
			- Can still control environment
			- Potential issues
				1. Litter and manure doesn't have anywhere to go
		3. Other systems
			- Free Range
				1. Like cage free but with some access to outside
				2. Access to forage is not required
			- Pasture Raised
				2. Have a cage free indoor area
				3. Must have access to outdoor area and access to natural vegetation
		4. How good are systems?
			- Big push for cage free bc it sounds better
				1. Cage free actually has highest mortality % due to sanitation and disease issues
					- Very tough problem to solve
					- Must dramatically decrease the density, which lowers productivity
					- Cannibalism of eggs is an issue as well
					- Pro is less confinement but cons are higher mortality and more disease
			- Enriched cage
			- Conventional battery cages has lowest mortality % overall
				1. Confinement is con but lower mortality and less disease is pro
			- Where are we headed?
				1. 1 in 6 Americans go hungry on any given day
					- We shouldn't make eggs more expensive
					- Very good food source
					- Cage free cost of production causes good food source to be harder to acquire
			- Free range
				1. Con is predation and disease and mortality depends on density
				2. Pro is less confinement
			- Pasture raised
				1. Con is predation and disease and mortality depends on density
				2. Pro is less confinement 
	- Debeaking
		1. Decreases injury and death due to cannibalism
		2. Trims off small edge to round the beak
		3. Birds can be very aggressive 
		4. Can still do well outside
	- In conventional system, eggs move down conveyor belt to scalding wash
		1. In Europe, eggs are not washed or refrigerated 
		2. Eggs have pores in them that bacteria can still live in even if washed
		3. Mucus film prevents material from getting in it and keeps egg hydrated
		4. Healthwise, works about the same
	- After wash, candling process looking for shell integrity
		1. Looks for cracks 
		2. Checks = pinhole crack
		3. Also look for meat and blood spots
			- When ovulation occurs, follicle may rupture capillaries
				1. Blood may come down in it
				2. Not harmful, but doesn't look good
			- Meat spot is hunk of tissue from the oviduct
				1. Tissue is constantly replacing itself in bird so piece may get incorporated in egg
		4. Some equipment that does this process by sound
			- Sound waves detect shell issues
		5. Sometimes there are eggs w/ no shell
			- Skipped step
		6. Eggs can be different sizes
			- Size of egg determined by material that goes down oviduct
				1. Like yoke
			- Double ovulation can make extra large egg
				2. Has two yokes
			- If fertilized, these eggs would not make it
	- Then go through series of grading
		1. Large vs extra large
		2. Grade AA, A, B
		3. If nothing is wrong w/ egg, no one has touch the egg
			1. W/ other operations, eggs are hand gathered
		4. Size (class) and Quality (grade)
			- Germinal around yoke is the unfertilized ovum
			- Albumin on inside (protein source
			- Chalazae hold yoke in middle
			- Inner and outer membrane
			- Shell on outside
			- Size (class) is based on weight by the dozen
				1. Jumbo, extra large, large, medium, small, peewee
			- Quality (grade) depends on the size of air cell (determines amount of material within egg)
				1. AA has smallest air cell, then A, then B
				2. Less air cell is better bc that means more material inside shell
					- More yoke + albumin
		1. Yolk color
			 - Controlled by zanthophylls and carotenes
				 1. Color pigmentations
				 2. Diet-related
				 3. What bird eats control coloration of yoke
			- Insects tend to be redder
			- Cottonseed makes yolks green
	- Laying Life Cycle
		1. Fertilization --> Hatching - incubation takes 21 days
			- The all moved in to grower
		2. At 6 months, all go out of grower
			- Removed from grower and enter laying phase
			- By 6 months, 10% of birds are laying
		3. Laying phase 1 is 50 weeks long
			- Controlled by 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness
			- Peak at about 20-30 weeks in before egg production goes down until 50 weeks
				1. Need recovery time
		4. Inducted molting occurs at end of laying phase
			- Turn off lights
				1. 24 hrs of light would do same thing repro wise, but more likely to attach each other then
				2. Change diurnal (24 hr light or dark)
			- Provide water but no feed
			- Do this until they lose about 25% of body weight
			- Quit laying eggs during this time
			- This allows *reproductive tract involution*
				1. Repair time
			- Also *gets rid of excess body fat*
			- This does not force feathers do stuff, but feathers do fall out more than they normally would bc stress of not eating
				1. Not a true molting
		5. Then go through laying phase II
			- Shorter than phase I (30-40 weeks)
		6. After laying phase II, some repeat another molt and phase, but many ship birds to processing

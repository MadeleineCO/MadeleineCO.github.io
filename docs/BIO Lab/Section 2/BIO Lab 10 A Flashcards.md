Nucleic acid is made up of ---::nucleotides bound by phosphodiester linkages
^1668191464846

Nucleotides are made up of ---::pentose sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base
^1668191464855

Pentose sugar can be either ---::deoxyribose or ribose; DNA (no O) = deoxyribose while RNA (hydroxyl group) = ribose
^1668191464861

Carbons labeled ---::1' (bound to nitrogenous base), 2', 3' (bound to nucleotide), 4', and 5' (bound to phosphate)
^1668191464867

DNA has a ---::directionality; Read 5' end to 3' end
^1668191464874

Base pairs::G links w/ C and A links w/ T in DNA
^1668191464880

DNA structure::Two polynucleotide chains made up of nucleotides w/ phosphate group, deoxyribose sugar, and nitrogenous base; Sugar and phosphate bake backbone
^1668191464886

A-T has --- H bonds while G-C has --- H bonds::2; 3; A-T separates more easily than GC (important for DNA replication); 10 nucleotides every full turn of DNA
^1668191464893

How does DNA work?::Acts as blueprint or recipe for living things; DNA instructs amino acids to form proteins; DNA inside nucleus while amino acids outside nucleus in cytoplasm (RNA transfers info from DNA to amino acids)
^1668191464899

RNA (biol)::Similar to DNA but single stranded and can leave nucleus; Ribosomes = protein building machines; DNA --> RNA --> ribosomes --> amino acids --> protein
^1668191481561

Sickle cell anemia (bioll)::Protein called hemoglobin; One nucleotide is wrong so hemoglobin protein is incorrect, leading to sickle-shaped blood cells
^1668191473865

DNA replication::Original DNA used as template for next DNA strand; Semiconservative = new copies each contain a new strand and an original strand
^1668191464908

Helicase::unwinds DNA double helix
^1668191464914

DNA polymerase III::Works down the leading strand and up the lagging strand; synthesizes complementary bases
^1668191464921

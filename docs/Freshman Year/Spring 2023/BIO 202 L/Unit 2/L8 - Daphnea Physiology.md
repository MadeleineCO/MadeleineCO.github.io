1. Daphnea
	1. Phylum Arthropoda -> Class Crustacea
	2. CDS
	3. Eucoelomate w/ well-developed organs
	4. Bilateral symmetry
	5. Outer shell
	6. Cephalization
		1. Eyespot
	7. Translucent 
	8. Has a heart located above the gut and beside the gonads
		1. We are going to look at the HR at a Daphnea
		2. Measuring Before adding a solution and after adding solution vs adding water
		3. Using ethanol (Both 5% and 10%) and caffeine (Both 0.5% and 2%)
	9. Diecious
		1. Eggs can be found in brood pouch
	10. Experiment starts w/ Daphnea in water
		1. View using low power on microscope
			1. See if you can find Daphnea heart
		2. A little bit of cotton should trap the Daphnea on its side
			1. Will then count HR
2. Science and Data
	1. The larger the data set, the more accurate the data
		1. Avg data from all groups and lab sections 
		2. Buffer against outliers 
		3. Larger sample size = greater confidence in accuracy of data
	2. Don't make assumptions, just hypothesize
	3. Blind experiment
		1. You don't know what solution you will be getting (could just be either A, B, C, or D)
	4. Double blind experiment
		1. When both the professors and the students don't know what solution is what
	5. Both blind and double blind experiments are meant to prevent bias
3. Assignment
	1. Find averages for all five solutions (A, B, C, D, E)
		1. 10 times per solution (w/ ten minute increments)
			1. 0-20 = water
			2. 30-60 = test solution
			3. 70-90 = water
		2. Find avg of each time for water before, solution times, and water after for each lab section first. Then avg those averages across all lab sections. 
			1. Separate averages for each solution across all lab sections
		3. Can create eight sheet with averages 
	2. Find standard error
		1. Find standard deviation before SE
		2. SE = SD/(sqrt(n))
		3. Show how you analyzed the data to find averages, SD, SE, etc.
	3. Two Graphs
		1. Independent variable = solutions
		2. Dependent variable = heart rate
		3. One graph for ethanol and one for caffeine (line graphs)
			1. Time is on the x-axis from 0 minutes to 90 minutes 
				1. Tick for each minute
			2. Heart is on y-axis in BPM
			3. First line = control (water - solution D)
			4. Second line = 5% ethanol or 0.5% caffeine
			5. Third line = 10% ethanol or 2% caffeine
	4. Must write results after the graphics 
		1. A description of the results 
		2. First state the effects of caffeine and ethanol, then go into more detail
		3. Do not add methods, discussion, etc.
		4. Total num of Daphnia tested
		5. Avg initial heart rate and range
		6. Change in HR in control animals over time
		7. Was effect reversable in any of the treatments?
		8. Did initial HR have effect on what happened during 80-90 minute trial?
	5. See grading rubric for details!!!

1. Energy is the capacity to do work
	1. Kinetic = energy of motion
	2. Potential = stored energy or energy of position
		- A suspended ball that is not currently moving has potential energy. If ball released, potential energy transformed to kinetic energy
		- Water behind a dam has potential energy. Moving water has kinetic energy.
2. Many forms such as mechanical, heat, sound, electric current, light, radioactivity, etc.
3. Heat is the most convenient way of measuring energy
	1. 1 calorie = heat required to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree C
	2. calorie vs. Calorie
		- Calorie w/ big C indicates a kilocalorie (usually in reference to food)
4. Photosynthetic [[organism|organisms]] capture energy from sun
	1. Sun is main source of energy in biological world
	2. Stored as potential energy in [[chemical bonds]]
	3. Energy is converted from energy form to energy form but cannot be created or destroyed
		- This process is the basis of [[metabolism]]
		- Molecules in gasoline contains chemical energy within the [[chemical bonds]]. This energy transformed to kinetic energy that allows car to move.
5. Delta G = change in free energy
	1. Positive Delta G (endergonic)
		- Products have more free energy than reactants 
		- H is higher or S is lower
		- Not spontaneous and requires input of energy
			- Work must be done for chemical reaction to occur
				1. Work = force over a distance (W = fd)
					1. Moving a package takes force to pick it up and distance to move it someplace else
					2. F = ma
						- If a baseball is thrown slowly, it has a little force. If thrown quickly, it has more force
					- W = mad
			- Building up energy
	2. Negative Delta G (exergonic)
		- Products have less free energy than reactants
		- H is lower or S is higher or both
		- Spontaneous (may not be instantaneous)
			- Doesn't require much work
			- Releases energy
	3. Ex: 
		- Compost pile = exergonic (decomposing releases energy)
			- You can feel heat release as plant material broken down
		- Chicken in an egg = endergonic (developing and gaining more energy)
			- Energy in a single cell is converted and [[cell]] divides over and over, gaining energy
		- Drawing sand art = endergonic (required energy to make the sand art)
		- Ball rolling down hill = endergonic (more energy at top of hill than at bottom)
	4. See graphs to visualize reactants energy vs products energy
		1. Ex: burning a log is an exergonic reaction (product energy < reactant energy as energy released in heat form)
	5. Photosynthesis starts w/ carbon dioxide and [[water]] but makes a sugar (endergonic)
	6. Aerobic respiration starts w/ sugar and releases carbon dioxide and water (exergonic)
6. Activation energy
	1. Energy required to begin chemical reactions
	2. Once reaction started, it can be exergonic or endergonic
	3. Catalysts lower activation energy ([[Metabolism]])
		1. If you lower activation energy, you can get the product more quickly
		2. If exergonic, can release energy faster
		3. [[Enzymes]]
	7. Laws of thermodynamics
		1. 1st law of thermodynamics
			- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
			- Can change forms, but total amount of energy in universe remains constant
				- During conversions, energy is lost as heat (still a form of energy)
		2. 2nd law of thermodynamics
			- Entropy = the amount of randomness or disorder in a system
			- With the passage of time, things break down and entropy (disorder) is continuously increasing
			- Energy transformations proceed spontaneously to convert matter from more ordered/less stable to less ordered/more stable
			- Liquid is more disordered than solid and gas more disordered than liquid
7. [[ATP]] is a form of energy in cells

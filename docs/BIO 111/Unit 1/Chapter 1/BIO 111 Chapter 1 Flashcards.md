Biology unifies much of---::natural science
^1661396868104

Living systems::The most complex chemical systems on Earth
^1661396868114

Life is constrained by the properties of::chemistry and physics
^1661396868121

Science is becoming more::interdiciplinary
^1661396868128

Seven characteristics of living organisms::Cells, Complex/ordered, Respond to environment, Grow/reproduce, Use energy, Maintain homeostasis, Evolutionary adaption
^1661396868134

Living systems and hierarchial organization::Cellular, organismal, populational, ecosystem, biosphere
^1661396868141

Cellular level::Atoms, molecules, organelles, cells
^1661396868148

Organismal level::Tissues, organs, organ systems
^1661396868154

Populational level::Population, community
^1661396868160

Ecosystem level:A group of populations/communities

Biosphere::Earth is a group of ecosystems
^1661396868167

The biological levels of organization::Organells (ex: nucleus), Cells, Tissues, Organ systems, Organisms and populations, Ecosystems, Biosphere
^1661396868173

The nature of science::Science begins with observations, therefore, much of science is purely descriptive
^1661396868180

Inductive reasoning::From a number of observations, a general conclusion is drawn
^1661396868186

Deductive reasoning::From a general premise, specific resultsl are predicted
^1661396868193

Scientific method::A series of well-defined steps
^1661396868200

If a --- is not supported by experimental data, a new --- can be proposed::hypothesis
^1661396868206

Steps of the scientific method::Observation, question, hypothesis, prediction, experiment, analize, repeat (if needed), report
^1661396868214

Reductionism::To break a complex process down to its simpler parts
^1661396868221

Systems biology::Focus on emergent properties that can't be understood by looking at simpler parts (Google and flue outbreaks, metagenomic investigation)
^1661396868228

Models in science::Way to organize thought, Parts provided by reductionism, suggests experiments to test model
^1661396868235

Scientific theory::Body of interconnected concepts, Supported by much experimental evidence and scientific reasoning, Expresses certain ideas, Can change w/ new info
^1661396868242

Cell theory::All organisms composed of cells as life's building block, All cells come from preexisting cells
^1661396868249

Molecular basis of inheritance::Deoxyribonucleic adic (DNA), Sequence of 4 nucleotides encode cell's info
^1661396868256

Gene::Discrete unit of info
^1661396868263

Genome::Entire set of DNA instructions
^1661396868270

Continuity of life depends on faithful --- into daughter cells::copying of DNA
^1661396868277

Study structure to learn ---::function
^1661396868284

If you know a function, you can look for that --- in other organisms::structure
^1661396868291

Diversity of life arises by ---::evolution
^1661396868298

Underlying unit of biochemistry and genetics argue for life from the same ---::origin event
^1661396868305

Diversity due to --- over time::evolutionary change
^1661396868312

3 Domains::Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya
^1661396868319

Bacteria::single-celled prokaryote
^1661396868326

Archaea::single-celled prokaryote
^1661396868332

Eukarya::single-celled or multicellular eukaryote (plantae, fungi, animalia, protista)
^1661396868339

Cells are --- systems::information-processing
^1661396868345

Information in DNA used to ---::direct synthesis of cellular components
^1661396868352

Cells process ---::environmental info (glucose levels, presence of hormones, etc.)
^1661396868358

Cells in multicellular organisms must --- :: coordinate with each other
^1661396868366

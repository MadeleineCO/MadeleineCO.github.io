1. [[Domestication]]
	- Wild cat
		1. Slowly domesticated over time (self domestication)
		2. Go feral more easily
	- Created breeds
		1. Squished nose, hairless, etc.
		2. Can create genetic problem=
	- One of only true carnivores to be domesticized
		1. Self-domestication
		2. One of only domesticated animals 
		3. Cats don't have tight social structures (unique among domesticated animals)
			- Very fluid socially
			- Limited social structure = limited hierarchy so harder to get cats to do what we want 
			- Most difficult to control among domestic animals
				1. Feral = Domesticated species that lives in a wild state or condition
				2. Easily go feral
					- Can produce very quickly
					- Around 60 million feral cats
					- Estimated to kill 1.3-4 billion birds and more mammals 
					- Carry parasites that can be zoonotic (can pass from animals to people)
					- Feral trapping
						1. Trap - Spay - Rehab
							- Problem w/ concept of rehabilitation 
								1. Rehab means to take it back to where it was
								2. However, one generation can go back to more wild state
						2. Trap - Spay or Neuter - Release
							- Reproductive Control (non lethal control)
							- Expensive
							- Application 
							- Does not remove the problem
								1. If you don't get critical mass, the taking out a few cats won't help
								2. If you loose them afterward, then you are not helping birds, mammals, parasite issues, etc. 
						3. Australia paid people to shoot cats
							- Cat bounty
							- Wisconsin tried similar idea but didn't work
	- ---
	- Often symbol of royalty
		1. Ex: Siamese cats only among royalty 
			 - Similar w/ South American countries
			 - Egypt has many many mummified cats
	- Later associated w/ things like witchcraft
		1. Cats could fall out of buildings and be fine
		2. Process of wiping out cats
		3. Still used on ships as ratters
			- A means to spread cats around the world
	- Bubonic plaque
		1. If you take cats out, more rats
		2. Rats spread disease
	- Breeds
		1. Somewhere between 40-100 recognized breeds
		2. Starting to mess w/ cats too
			- Persian face
			- Longhaired cats generally have lower survival rate (matts, bacteria, fungi)
			- Sphynx cat has no hair
	- Obesity now a problem w/ cats
1. [[Carnivores]]
2. Terms
	- Adult female = queen (molly, dam)
	- Adult male = Tom
	- ---
3. Reproduction
	- Cats are polyestrous (have multiple estrus cycles per year)
	- Estrous cycles avg of 14-21 days but can rang from 4-30d
	- Estrus lasts about 7-8 days
	- Tend to be seasonal
		1. Increase in estrous cycles in spring and fall (different from short day, long day)
		2. Can still do whatever overall
	- Induced ovulation 
		1. Breeding must occur to start events leading to ovulation (neural reflex)
		2. Stimulates neural reflex (nervous system is involved) after mating occurs
		3. If cat does not mate, follicles regress and decompose without ovulation
		4. If cat does mate, corpus luteum grows, P4 and pregnancy, parturition, lactation
		5. Rabbits also have induced ovulation 
		6. False pregnancy
			- Uterus expands, mammary development, some even have false labor
			- More commonly occurs in induced ovulation animals
	- If animal is indoors, tend to show more estrous cycles than those outdoors
		1. Photo period influence
		2. Long haired cats have fewer estrous cycles than short haired cats
			1. 50% of short hair cycles year round
	- Queens that are housed together tend to have synchronized estrous cycles
	- ---
4. People who are allergic to cats are allergic to oils from glands and dandruff (excess skin cells)
	- Allerca eliminated oil gene so hypoallergenic
	- Probably not great for cat

Charles Darwin::Noted the huge range of diversity in animal species while travelling to the Galapagos Islands; Collected species and sent to experts; Wondered if species were not fixed
^1673464967699

Natural selection::Survival of the fittest; The environment selects for species with the greatest survivability; Noted by Darwin
^1673464967717

Darwin's finches::Darwin observed that finch beaks varied widely depending on their food sources; Led to belief that species change over time along w/ environment

An example of artificial selection is ---::dog domestication; Humans created many breeds of domestic dogs
^1673464967733

In June of 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace sent his essay about evolution and natural selection to Darwin; Soon after, Darwin published his theories in *The Origin of Species*

The fossil record can show the progression of ---::evolution; Missing link fossils; Fossils of life in very old rocks

Mapping the sea floor led to the discovery of ---::continental drift; Shifting continents explains why there are similar species across continents
^1673464967754

Different variation of senses::On some microscopic species, there are light sensitive spots; Different range of eye function
^1673464967761

Gregor Mender::Discovered the laws of inheritance; Recessive vs dominant; Existence of genes
^1673464967768

^1674249384586

One of the things that Darwin noticed about the natural world (and contributed greatly to his formulation of how evolution works) was that ---::organisms often produce an overabundance of offspring
^1674249384590

A famous fossil called _Archaeopteryx_ was shown in the "Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life" film. Â This fossilized animal was found within a limestone quarry in Bavaria as rectangles of limestone were split apart to make roofing tiles. _Archaeopteryx_ is significant because it shows an evolutionary link between ---::reptiles and birds

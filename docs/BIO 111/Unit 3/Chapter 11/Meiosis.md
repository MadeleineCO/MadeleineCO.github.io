1. Synopsis ([[Sexual Reproduction]])
	- Meiosis includes two rounds of division
		1. Meiosis I and Meiosis II
			- Each has prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages
	  - Prophase I
		  1. You have two copies of chromosomes from S phase before meiosis
			  - Homologous chromosomes become closely associated (condense and become visible to microscope)
				  1. Longer arm = Q and Shorter arm = P
			  - The chromosome line up to form a synapse.
		  2. Includes formation of synaptonemal complexes
			  - Formation also called tetrad or bivalents
			  - Form synapsis 
				  1. After they are replicated, the chromosomes are bound tightly together in perfect alignment by a [[Protein]] lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesion proteins at the centromere
		3. Crossing over
			- Genetic recombination between nonsister chromatids (one from father and one from mother)
				1. Allows the homologues to exchange chromosomal material
				2. Alleles of genes that were formerly on separate homologues can now be found on the same homologue
				3. When lined up by the protein lattice (synaptonemal complex), they can exchange nucleotides of [[DNA]] to make new combo of genes
					- Creates new genetic diversity
				4. Ends of chromosomes (closer to telomeres) tend to cross over more than regions closer to centromeres
			- Chiasmata = site of crossing over
				1. Contact maintained until anaphase I
	- Metaphase I
		1. Paired homologues move to the metaphase plate and become oriented w/ homologues of each pair attached to opposite poles of the spindle
			- In [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|mitosis]], homologues act independently, whereases in meiosis, there are two possible arrangements at the equatorial place.
				1. Possible num of different gametes is 2n where n = num of chromosomes
					- n = 23 in human [[cell|cells]], so over 8 mil possible combinations
		2. Terminal chiasmata hold homologues together following crossing over 
		3. Microtubules from opposite poles attach√© to each homologue
			- Not each sister chromatid
		4. Each pole has a complete haploid set of chromosomes consisting of one member of each homologous pair
		5. Independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes
			- Maternal and paternal chromosomes stay together
	- Anaphase I
		1. Homologues pulled to opposite poles for each pair of chromosomes
			- In mitosis, sister chromatids are pulled to opposite poles whereas in meiosis, it is more random
				1. Crossing other and pulling apart different assortments of nonsister chromosomes to different poles creates more genetic diversity
	- Telophase I

- The Process of Meiosis
	1. Meiotic [[cell|cells]] have interphase period that is similar to mitosis w/ G1, S, and G2 phases
	2. After interphase, germline cells enter meiosis I
	3. After meiosis 1, they enter meiosis II (no second round of interphase or chromosomal division)
- Meiosis II Synopsis 
	1. Resembles a [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|mitotic]] division
	2. Prophase II
		- Nuclear envelopes dissolve and new spindle apparatus forms
	3. Metaphase II
		- Chromosomes align on the metaphase plate
	4. Anaphase II
		- Sister chromatids are separated from each other
	5. Telophase II
		- Nuclear envelope reforms around 4 sets of daughter chromosomes
		- Cytokinesis follows
2. An animal cell w/ diploid num of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four haploid daughter [[cell|cells]]
	- Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of [[DNA]] replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear divisions. The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the parent cell.
	- Final result
		1. Four [[cell|cells]] containing haploid sets of chromosomes
		2. In animals, develop directly into gametes
		3. In plants, fungi, and many protists, divide mitotically
			- Produce greater num of gametes
			- Adults w/ varying nums of gametes
3. Meiosis vs [[Eukaryotic Cell Cycle|Mitosis]]

1. [[Passive transport]]
	 1. The net diffusion of [[water]] across [[plasma membranes]] toward a higher solute concentration
		- Exclusively water diffusion
	2. Cytoplasm of [[cell]] is an aqueous solution
		- [[Water]] is solvent
		- Dissolved substances are solutes (molecules other than water)
	3. Osmotic Concentration
		- [[Water]] always moves towards high concentration of solute
		- When 2 solutions have different osmotic concentrations
			- Hypertonic solute has higher solute concentration
				1. Water moves towards hypertonic direction
				2. Inside of [[cell]] is above solute level of extracellular fluid
			- Hypotonic solution has lower solute concentration
				1. Water moves away from hypotonic direction
				2. Inside of [[cell]] is below solute level of extracellular fluid
			- Isotonic means two solutions have same osmotic concentration
				1. No net movement of water
		- Aquaporins facilitate osmosis
			- Channels that facilitates [[water]] movement across the membrane
			- Like pipes
				1. Open allows water to flow through to get a lot of water through
			- Water can go across is smaller amounts via diffusion without aquaporins
		- Osmotic pressure
			- Force needed to stop osmotic flow
			- [[Cell]] in a hypotonic solution gains water causing cell to swell (creates pressure)
			- If [[plasma membranes]] are strong enough, cells reach counterbalance of osmotic pressure driving water in with hydrostatic pressure driving water out
				1. Cell wall of [[Prokaryotic Cell|prokaryotes]], fungi, plants, and protists prevent cell from bursting
				2. Gets stiffer but does not break
				3. Watered plants are stiffer than wilted plants with little water
			- If membrane is not strong, may burst
				1. Animal cells must be in isotonic environments or fatal
			- Semipermeable membrane
				1. In osmosis, [[water]] moves from high to low. Solute cannot pass through selectively permeable membrane but water can. Allows water to counterbalance solute amounts
				2. Blood cells are very sensitive to water
					1. If hypertonic, water flows out and cell shrinks 
					2. If hypotonic, water flows in and cell expands
				3. If you put freshwater fish in salt water, it dies of dehydration
					1. Hypertonic so water flows towards solute outside of fish
					2. Vise versa w/ salt water fish in freshwater
			- Maintaining osmotic balance
				1. Some [[cell|cells]] use extrusion in which water is ejected through contractile vacuoles
					- Like a pump that gets [[water]] out of cell if osmotic pressure starts to build too much
					- Prevents bursting
				2. Isosmotic regulation involves keeping cells isotonic w/ their environment
					1. Marine organisms adjust internal concentration to match sea water
					2. Terrestrials animals circulate isotonic fluid
						- Can pick up ions when circulating so filter blood through kidneys
							- Allows blood to maintain proper balance
					3. Plant cells use turgor pressure to push [[cell]] membrane against the cell wall and keep cell rigid
						- Hypertonic = too little turgor pressure; plasma membrane pulled in and everything is concentrated
							- Cell wall remains same, but inside is condensed
							- Dark green and wilted (concentrated chloroplast and separated from cell wall)
						- Hypotonic = too much turgor pressure; [[plasma membranes|plasma membrane]] pressed against cell wall
							- Light green bc chloroplast spread out
							- Erect and stiff plant
					4. A paramecium’s contractile vacuole continuously pumps [[water]] out of the organism’s body to keep it from bursting in a hypotonic medium

1. [[Modern Understanding of Inheritance]]
2. DNA mutations can cause altered proteins once the genes are transcribed and translated
	- Altered structure = altered function
	- Causes phenotypic change
	- In some cases, [[protein]] ---
	- Sickle cell anemia
		1. On p arm, there is beta hemoglobin gene 
			- Normal hemoglobin is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains. A certain nucleotide creates glutamic acid on normal beta chain in primary [[protein]] sequence.
			- At gene that should create glutamic acid at certain point is mutated as a different nucleotide that creates valine instead. 
				1. Creates nonpolar region that clusters w/ other nonpolar things.
				2. Causes red blood [[cell|cells]] to have altered shapes.
3. Some genetic disorders are caused by changes in chromosome number
	- Nondisjunction during meiosis can create gametes that have too many or too few chromosomes
		1. Could occur in meiosis I or meiosis II
			- Either way, ends up w/ gametes w/ too many (trisomy) or too few (monosomic/aneuploid)
		2. Typically, the lower the chromosome number affected, the greater the severity
			- Ex: Worse in 1,2,3 than 22, 21, 20
			- Lower numbers less frequent in human births than higher numbers bc embryos become less viable
				1. More deadly
				2. More miscarriages/spontaneous abortions 
	- Fertilization of these gametes creates trisomic (too many copies) or monosomic (too few copies) individuals 
	- Down Syndrome
		1. Also called trisomy 21
		2. Three copies of chromosome 21
		3. Different degrees of severity and phenotypic characteristics
		4. The incidence of Down Syndrome increases w/ mother's age bc nondisjunction during meiosis increases w/ aging
	- Nondisjunction of sex chromosomes of females can result in. . .
		1. Triple-X syndrome daughters
			- No phenotypic association 
		2. XXY sons (Klinefelter syndrome) sons
			- Blending of male and female characteristics but still male bc of F chromosome
			- More common than Jacob's syndrome
		3. XO daughters (Turner syndrome)
			- Only one X chromosome (aneuploid)
		4. XYY sons (Jacob's syndrome)
		5. OY = nonviable zygotes
		6. Punnitt Squares 
			- Normal male x nondisjunction eggs (one XX one XO)
4. Sometimes, parts of chromosomes can break off or be deleted
	- Cri-du-chat syndrome
		1. Occurs when section of chromosome 5 is missing
		2. Distinctive facial features 
	- 1-p36 deletion syndrome
		1. Deletion of gene 36 on p arm of chromosome 1
	- If baby develops and is born, there is often some level of developmental disability
	- Part of chromosome 4 can break than be attached to chromosome 12
5. Maternal inheritance = uniparental (one parent) inheritance from mother only
	- Mitochondrial [[DNA]] is maternally inherited 
	- Mitochondria and Mitochondrial DNA are in eggs but not usually in sperm. So, mitochondria in the offspring come from the mother.
		1. Creates issues w/ mitochondria and energy
	- Cases where you can insert good mitochondria DNA into an egg w/ mitochondrial disorder to fix it
	- If you have root of hair, you get nuclear [[DNA]], but if you don't get root, you can still find mitochondrial DNA
		1. Mitochondrial [[DNA]] can also be extracted from bone

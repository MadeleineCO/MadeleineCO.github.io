1. All cells have a cell membrane (or plasma membrane
	1. Semi-permeable/selectively permeable
		- Lets some things in and excludes others
		- Ability to pass determined by size, polarity, and concentration gradient
			- Small molecules can probably pass, but larger molecules cannot unless aided by proteins
			- If a strong concentration on one side and a small concentration on another side, then diffusion from high to low concentration
	1. Phospholipid bilayer
		- 2 phospholipids back to back
		- Fluid mosaic proteins 
			- Like doors 
			- Controls what can go in or out
2. Cells must be small
	1. Surface area to volume ratio
		- A bigger space needs lots of doors and vice versa
		- Surface area is the outside area
		- Volume is the internal area
		- If volume expands, the surface area cannot keep up. If cell gets too big, it bursts like a water balloon or will not function properly
3. Diffusion
	1. Spread from high concentration to low concentration
	2. Will eventually equilibrate if given the opportunity 
	3. Plasma membrane can be a barrier to diffusion
		- Size and polarity may hinder molecules
	4. Osmosis
		- The diffusion of water
		- Water molecules are relatively small and some, but not much polarity
			- Can cross the cell membrane passively
4. Tonicity
	1. Solution: something that is dissolved in water (ex sucrose solution is water + sucrose)
	2. Solvent: usually water (what you are dissolving solute in)
	3. Solute: whatever is dissolved in solvent (ex sucrose, salt, etc.)
	4. When comparing two solutions, the one with higher concentrations of solute is hypertonic
		1. Solution w/ lower concentration of solute is hypotonic
	5. Water always moves from hypotonic to hypertonic (less solute --> more solute; more water --> less water)
		1. Net movement (individual molecules in constant motion)
		2. Causes hypertonic cells to gain water and swell
		3. Causes hypotonic cells to lose water and shrink

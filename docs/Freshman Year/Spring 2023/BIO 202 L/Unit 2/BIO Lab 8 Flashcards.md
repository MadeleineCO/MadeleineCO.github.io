Daphnia are apart of phylum ---::arthropoda (class crustacea)
^1678924758460

Daphnia characteristics::CDS; Eucoelomate w/ well-developed organs; Bilateral; Outer shell; Cephalization (eyespots); Translucent; Diecious
^1678924758472

The heart of a daphnia is located ---::above the gut and beside the gonads; Translucent
^1678924758480

We looked at the HR of a daphnia in --- and ---::water (before and after adding solution); an unknown solution (either A, B, C, or D)
^1678924758488

The unknown solutions could either contain ---::ethanol (5% or 10%) or caffeine (0.5% or 2%)
^1678924758495

The larger the data set, the more --- the data::accurate; We will avg data from all groups and lab sections to buffer against outliers
^1678924758503

Blind experiment::When "patient" (you in this experiment) doesn't know what solution is given (could either be A, B, C, or D)
^1678924758510

Double blind experiment::When both the researcher (professors in this experiment) and the "patient" (you in this experiment) don't know what solution is what
^1678924758517

Both blind and double blind experiments are meant to prevent ---::bias; Don't make assumptions, just hypothesize

Daphnia are small freshwater ---::crustaceans; AKA water fleas; Members of phylum Arthropoda, subphylum Crustacea
^1679355588500

Daphnia are quiet important in --- food cycles::aquatic; Feed on algae and may be food source for fish and insects
^1679355588507

Daphnia species are frequently used by scientists as an ---::"indicator species" in ecological and toxicological studies
^1679355588514

A daphnia's clear exoskeleton allows scientists to monitor their ---::heart rate after being exposed to different compounds (ethanol - 5% or 10% OR caffeine 0.5% or 2%)
^1679355588521

What results do you expect for the different compounds?::I expect caffeine to increase HR according to its dosage and ethanol to decrease HR according to its dosage
^1679355588528

^1679355588535

Procedure::Obtain Daphnia + water slide -> Trap w/ cotton -> Determine baseline HR three times by counting BPM -> Exchange water for one of four test solutions (A, B, C, or D) -> Measure BPM of HR four times -> Exchange solution for water and flush -> Determine baseline HR again three times by counting BPM
^1679355588541

What is the independent variable in the experiment?::Solution A, B, C, or D
^1679355588548

What is the dependent variable in the experiment?::Heart Rate
^1679355588555

How will you graphically represent the combined data from the experiment? Which variable should be on x-axis? Y-axis?::Bar graph; Solutions on x-axis; Average HR on y-axis
^1679355588561

Name **one** of the drugs that was tested on _Daphnia_ (in either experiment).::Ethanol
^1680132256145

Why was our experiment considered to be aÂ "**blind**" experiment?::The students did not know which solution was which. Only the professors were aware of this.
^1680132256152

What was the **dependent** variable in our experiment with _Daphnia_?::Daphnia Heart Rate (BPM)
^1680132256158

This animal (_Daphnia_) has a true body cavity that is completely lined with ---::mesoderm (i.e., it is a coelomate) and it has a complete digestive system.
^1680132256163

We experimented with _Daphnia_ in lab last week. What **Phylum** does this animal belong to?::Arthropoda

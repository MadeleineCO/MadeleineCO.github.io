1. Phenotypic variation
	1. Varied expression in the same population 
		1. Individuals don't look identical
		2. Different enzymes or proteins that may not be as visual
		3. Ex: Feral horse populations
			1. Coloration differences in mustangs
	2. Single vs multiple genes
		1. Could be single difference, but more likely multiple genes are involved in the expression of the phenotype
2. Natural selection
	1. Random mutations --> non-random selection
		1. Natural selection applies pressure on mutations
		2. Mutations could be adaptive or maladaptive
			1. Adaptive generally stay while maladaptive may die off
	2. Selected traits become more common
3. Genetic drift
	1. Change alone shifts phenotype
	2. Ex: random natural disaster kills off black hares so brown hares dominant population
	3. Genes become more common over generations due to change in environment
4. Gene flow
	1. New alleles enter the population
	2. Emigration of new genes
	3. New phenotypes in new generations
5. Individual genetic variation
	1. Gene variability
		1. Whole-gene level variation
		2. Refers to the proportion of zygosity
		3. Ex: fruit fly
			1. 14% -> heterozygous
			2. 84% -> homozygous
	2. Nucleotide variability
		1. Refers to the molecular variation in DNA
		2. Most variations do not equal change in phenotype
			1. Mutations within an intron
				1. Introns are spliced out so no effect
				2. Most exon mutations do not change amino acids significantly
					1. Even if there is AA change: negatively charged amino acid 1 swapped for negatively charge amino acid 2 = no significant effect
						1. Redundancy may prevent change
		3. One change can be significant
	3. Nonheritable variation
		1. Acquired traits cannot be passed
			1. Cannot change phenotype to change genotype
			2. Refutes Lamarks ideas
		2. Ex: Body builders do not produce muscular offspring
			1. Ability to gain mass/muscle could be passed on but not the phenotype itself
6. Sources of genetic variation
	1. New (mutant) alleles
		1. Most detrimental at present
			1. Heterozygote could protect against detrimental allele
				1. Heterozygote advantage and sickle cell anemia
			2. May become important later for the species
	2. Neutral variation
		1. No observed affect/advantage
		2. Could be related to non-coding DNA, redundancy in codons, or new amino acid (AA) keeps protein functions
	3. Only passed from germ cells
	4. Gene number/position
		1. Translocations of one gene
			1. Large translocation is usually bad 
			2. Small translocation could be good
				1. Depends on environment
		2. May accumulate through time
			1. If beneficial, may accumulate
			2. If detrimental, dead
		3. Ex: Gene for olfaction
			1. Initially had one gene in vertebrates 
			2. Duplicated many times
			3. Humans have 380 genes, mice have 1200 olfactory genes
	5. Rapid reproduction
		1. Eukaryotic organisms 
			1. Animals and plants have low mutation rates (1 in 100,000 genes per generation)
				1. Means that DNA replication is working
				2. On a individual level, this is good for eukaryotes
		2. Prokaryotes and viruses
			1. Quick generation time increases likelihood of mutations
				1. Able to reproduce very very rapidly compared to eukaryotes
			2. HIV is an RNA virus -> many mutations
				1. Mutate strains are often resistant
					1. Makes it difficult to treat HIV
						1. Prescribed HAART "cocktails"
							1. Multiple drugs that are necessary to combat mutant HIV strands
	6. Sexual Reproduction
		1. Shuffling of alleles
		2. Crossing-over (P1)
		3. Independent assortment (MI)
		4. Fertilization (Ndad + Nmom = 2Nz)

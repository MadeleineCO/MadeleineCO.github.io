1. Under [[Clade Gnathostome]] and [[Clade Osteichthyes]]
2. Name = "four limbs"
	1. Four-legged vertebrates 
	2. Ossified endoskeleton
3. Unique characteristics
	1. Increased bony support
		1. Vertebrae and girdles
		2. Vertebrae and ribs
			1. Better lung ventilation
		3. More robust
	2. Formation of a neck
		1. No direct connection between skull and pectoral girdle
			1. Can turn head without turning body
	3. Unique internal nostril
		1. Related to vestibular system (balance)
	4. Lung breathing 
		1. Ex: of convergent evolution in some bony fish
4. Major groups
	1. Amphibians
	2. Reptiles
	3. Birds
	4. Mammals
5. Class Amphibia
	1. Name = "double life"
		1. Metamorphosis

	2. Characteristics
		1. Smooth, permeable skin
			1. Cutaneous respiration
			2. Breath across skin
		2. Gills, lungs, and skin
			1. Positive pressure
				1. Forces air through skin by using cavities
				2. We use negative pressure breathing 
			2. Lungs aren't very efficient
				1. Some don't have lungs
			3. Obligate skin breathers
				1. Bioindicators of how the env is doing

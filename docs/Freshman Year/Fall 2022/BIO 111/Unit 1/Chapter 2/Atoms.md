1. All matter composed of [[Atoms]]
	1. Understanding the structure of atoms is critical to understanding the nature of biological molecules
	2. Unique structure with unique function
2. 3 Major particles
	1. Nucleus
		- Protons
			1. Positive charge
		- Neutrons
			1. No charge
	2. [[Electrons]]
3. The number of protons and electrons make each [[Element]] unique
	A. Atomic number = num of protons
		- Number of protons equals number of electrons when naturally neutral
			a. Atoms are electrically neutral
			b. Every atom of a particular element has the same number of protons
	B. Atomic mass
		- Mass or weight?
			a. Mass refers to amount of substance
			b. Weight refers to force gravity exerts on substance
		- Sum of protons and neutrons is the atom's atomic mass
			a. Each proton and neutron has a mass of approximately 1 Dalton
		- Listed on the periodic table
			a. Atomic mass (rounded to whole number) can tell you the number of protons and neutrons together
				i. Atomic mass - Atomic number = number of neutrons

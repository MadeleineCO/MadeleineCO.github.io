Deuterostome::Anus forms first and mouth forms second; Radial and indeterminate cleavage; Coelom formed by outpocketing of archenteron
^1677762721856

Superphylum Deuterostoma includes Phylum --- and Phylum ----::Echinodermata; Chordata; Both have *endoskeletons* in addition to deuterostome characteristics
^1677762721869

The endoskeleton in echinoderms is not made of bone but still serves as ---::support; Produces spiny skin feeling
^1677762721877

All echinoderms are based on --- symmetry::pentaradial; Larvae are bilateral but adults are pentaradial
^1677762721884

Ex of animals in Phylum Echinodermata::Sea urchins, sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, sea lilies
^1677762721892

Sea stars are within Phylum Echinodermata and Class ---::Asteroidea
^1677762721898

Characteristics of sea stars (C. Asteroidea)::Spiny outside (protection/support); Tube feet (locomotion, grasping objects, adhesion, etc.); 5 arms (identical internal organs); Central disk (middle)
^1677762721906

Animals w/ pentaradial symmetry, such as sea stars, have --- and --- surfaces instead of anterior and posterior::oral (on bottom along w/ mouth); aboral (on top)
^1677762721914

The central disk refers to the --- of sea stars::middle; Contains the *madreporite*, which allows water to enter the *water vascular system*
^1677762721922

Sea star dissection process::Remove tips of three arms; Make incision on either side of arms; Lift skin and remove top dermal surface from central disk; Observe internal structures
^1677762721930

Pyloric ceca::Functions like a liver in sea stars; Used for digestion; Lighter pink material within the sea star
^1677762721937

The gonad structures in sea stars (which are diecious) is darker than the --- material::pyloric ceca
^1677762721946

Ambulacral ridge::Runs down the middle of each sea star arm; Jelly like structures around it called *ampullae*; Involved in the *water vascular system*
^1677762721954

Flow of water in a sea star's water vascular system::Water -> Madreporite -> Series of canals (rain canal to radial canal) -> Water fills ampullae above tube feet (when squeezed, pushes water to extend the tube feet)
^1677762721962

Dermal ossicles::Skin bones of the sea star; Connected to the spine; Part of the endoskeleton system
^1677762721970

The spongy mass in the central disk area of the sea star is the ---::stomach; Sea stars have several stomachs, and they can turn one inside out and push it out the mouth to feed; Complete digestive system w/ small pore for anus
^1677762721977

Defining characteristics of Phylum Chordata::Notochord; Dorsal hollow nerve chord; Pharyngeal slits (holes in anterior portion of DS); Post-anal tail; (endostyle?)
^1677762721984

Chordates may lose any of their defining features when transitioning into ---::adulthood
^1677762721991

Protochordates::Invertebrate chordates; Only two major subphyla - S. P. Cephalochordata and S.P. Urochordata
^1677762721998

Subphylum Urochordata::The *tunicates*; Adults are sessile (lose notochord, post-anal tail, and DHNC); Filter feeders; Incurrent siphon and excurrent siphon (cilia draw water in IS and out ES)
^1677762722005

Subphylum Cephalochordata::The *lancelets*; Two pointed ends; DHNC w/ eyespot near the front; Notochord (semiflexible rod to stiffen body); Retain phalangeal slits and post-anal tail as well
^1677762722013

The anterior-most structure of lancelets is the ---::rostrum (helps w/ burrowing); Also have buccal cirri tentacles by mouth (for suspension/filter feeding)
^1677762722020

Lancelets have both --- fins but no --- fins::dorsal and caudal; paired
^1677762722028

Myomeres::Segmented muscles seen in lancelets
^1677762722036

Lancelet Digestive System::Buccal cavity (mouth) -> Velum -> Pharynx (w/ gill bars and gill slits) -> Stomach (w/ hepatic caecum (liver) attached) -> Intestines -> Anus; Complete
^1677762722043

Lancelets depend on mucusy cilia to draw --- in::food; Seen on wheel organ in the buccal (mouth) cavity; Filter feeders
^1677762722050

Subphylum of Phylum Chordata::Protochordates (S.P. Cephalochordata and S.P. Urochordata); S.P. Vertebrata
^1677762722057

Echinoderms and Chordates are both ---::deuterostomes
^1679250191093

Which structures are major diagnostic features of Chordates::(NEDPP); Notochord, Endostyle, Dorsal Hollow Nerve Chord, Post-anal tail, Phalangeal slits
^1679250191117

What is the name of the surface where the mouth of the sea star is located?::oral
^1679250191127

What type of body symmetry does the Amphioxus/lancelet exhibit?::bilateral
^1679250191135

A large brown organ extended down the entire arm of the sea star. What was it? (hint: it secretes enzymes)::pyloric ceca

1. Dairy
	1. The number of dairy cows has dropped but production has increased
		1. Increase in efficiency overall 
		2. Fewer animals for greater amount of dairy production
	2. We have selected more efficient animals over time
	3. Better for farmers and the environment
	4. 35% more milk w/ 65% fewer cows than 65 yrs ago
3. Swine
	1. FE (feed efficiency) = 6:1 down to 2.5:1
		1. Feed efficiency is how well an animal converts feed into product
		2. We are using less feed overall for the same product
			1. Before, for every 6 lbs of feed you get 1 lb of meat
			2. Now, for every 2.5 lbs of feed you get 1 lb of meat
	2. Fat to lean
		1. We started selecting for lean meat rather than fatty meat
4. Wool
	1. 4x production
	2. We have selected animals w/ fast-growing fleece
	3. Wool is a trait has moderate to high heritability
		1. *Heritability* is the degree of responsiveness of a trait to selection
			1. Scale of 0-1
			2. A trait w/ 0.0-0.2, it has low heritability
			3. 0.21-0.4 = medium heritability
			4. 0.41-0.99 = high heritability
		2. Wool is 0.3-0.7 on the heritability scale
			1. Moderate to high heritability so progress is quicker 
5. Egg Production
	1. Jungle Fowl 
		1. Ancestor of current chickens 
		2. Produce about 15 eggs per year
			1. Now white leghorns lay about 300 eggs per year due to selection
	2. We can have fewer chickens but still a great number of eggs due to increased efficiency
6. Broilers (Meat)
	1. From 12 weeks to 42 days
		1. In past, it took 12 weeks for birds to reach proper weight
		2. Due to selection, broilers reach proper weight in just 6 weeks (42 days)
	2. Now having chickens w/ leg problems and skeletal problems
		1. We are changing are breeding programs that select for welfare as well as fast growth
7. Turkeys
	1. AI is required due to selection for breast meat
		1. Sexual dimorphism between male and female
			1. Male is too big to breed
		2. Semen from male turkeys last longer in female tract compared to chickens
			1. In chickens, must AI every 10 days
			2. In turkeys, 21 days
	2. All improvement done through selection
8. Beef
	1. Little change in production
	2. Everything in dairy is focused on more milk, but in beef we want increased fertility (one calf per year), feed efficient, more meat, etc.
		1. Dairy is much further ahead than beef
9. Horses
	1. No change in speed index in 40 years
10. Dogs
	1. Changes have both positive and negative effects
		1. Ex: we have bred bulldogs to have negative jaw shapes that causes many problems
11. Cats
	1. Changes have both positive and negative effects
		1. Ex: Persian cats have facial issues related to their flat face
12. Genetic Selection Effects
	1. Dairy - 35% more milk w/ 63% fewer cows than 65 yrs ago
	2. Swine - Change in feed efficiency and phenotype (fat --> lean)
	3. Sheep - Wool increased in volume 4x/fleece
	4. Chicken
		1. Laying - Jungle fowl (15-30 eggs per yr) -->
		2. ---
	5. ---
13. AI Use
	1. See graphic on canvas
	3. Dairy - High cryopreservation of sperm, high use of AI, high level of phenotypic change
		1. Cryopreservation = ability to keep semen in cold environment for a long time 
	4. Beef - High cryopreservation of sperm, low use of AI, low level of phenotypic change
		1. People don't use it much bc many are part time ranchers (need to spend on synchronization, technology, etc. so not worth it to them)
			1. Practical but not profitable
		2. Most just buy a good bull
		3. No changes on a wide scale
	5. Horses - Low, although increasing, cryopreservation of sperm, low/mod use of AI, low level of phenotypic change
	6. Poultry - Low cryopreservation of sperm, high (fresh) use of AI, high level of phenotypic change
	7. Swine - Low cryopreservation of sperm, mod/high use of AI, high level of phenotypic change
		1. Gestation length  = 3 months, 3 weeks, 3 days
		2. Farrowing occurs 2.5 times per year
			1. A gilt can have 12-16 piglets
		3. Can generate a lot during a short period of time
	8. Sheep/goat - Low cryopreservation of sperm, low use of AI, high level of phenotypic change

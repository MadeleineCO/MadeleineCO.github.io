1. [[Cell Communication]]
2. Very specialized form of paracrine signaling
3. Synaptic gap is the distance between the presynaptic [[cell]] and the postsynaptic cell
	- Very small and allows for rapid diffusion of neurotransmitters
	- [[Enzymes]] in synaptic cleft degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal
		1. There is excitatory neurotransmitter called acetylcholine that can make muscles contract. Pesticides targets enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine called acetylcholinesterase. Signal does not turn off so muscle keeps firing, which requires [[energy]]. Bugs use up all their energy and die. 
4. Membrane-bound neurotransmitters in vesicles are carried through presynaptic [[cell]] then released out of vesicles to diffuse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell; Then destroyed by [[enzymes]]
5. Neurons
	- Have long skinny piece called axon
	- Axon connected to portion called [[cell]] body with nucleus
	- [[Cell]] body surrounded by projections called dendrites
	- Axon terminal is on the other side of the axon
		1. Axon terminal on one neuron can bind to dendrites on other neurons
	- Signals go one direction
		1. Moves from dendrites down across [[cell]] body and axon to axon terminal
	- Neurons don't divide
		1. Paralysis cant heal itself
	- Receptors could be in dendrites or on non neural cells such as muscles 
6. Neuromuscular junctions
	- When neurons can bind via neurotransmitters to muscle cells
7. Two types of signals
	- Excitatory signal
	- Inhibitory signal
	- Excitatory and inhibitory signals can both bind on a neuron and have opposite effects
8. Many different neurotransmitters
	- When serotonin concentrations not right, problems arise such as depression
		1. SSRI drugs
			- Antidepressants
			- Sometimes serotonin gets destroyed too quickly by [[enzymes]] so it doesn't have enough effect, so these drugs slow down the breaking down of serotonin 
9. Distance is very small and signals work very rapidly

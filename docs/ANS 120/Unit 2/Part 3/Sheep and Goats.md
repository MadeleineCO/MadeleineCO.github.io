1. Among the earliest domesticated species ([[Domestication]])
2. Differences between sheep and goats
	- Hair coat
		1. Goats only have hair
		2. Most sheep have wool, but some hair breeds
	- Tails
		1. Sheep have long tails
		2. Goats have short, vertical tails
	- Horns
		1. Goats have narrow, curving horns
		2. Sheep have broad, curling horns if present
	- Upper lip
		1. Goats = continuous
		2. Sheep = separate lobes
	- Genetic
		1. Goats have 60 chromosomes
		2. Sheep have 54
		3. Cannot be crossed
	- Diet
		1. Goats do NOT eat everything
			- Broader diet than sheep
			- Can still be picky eaters
			- Browsing animal
				1. Prefer leaves, vines, forbs, fruit, nuts, tender shrubs, young bark
				2. Very wide variety of forages
				3. Concentrate selectors 
					- Have smaller rumen than sheep
		1. Sheep prefer a smaller variety of food
			- Grazing animal
				1. More limited variety of forages
				2. Prefer grasses, legumes, and weeds
					- NOT exclusive, only preference 
					- Bigger rumen than goats bc more fibrous material
				3. Harder for necks to reach up high than goats
	3. Sheep
		- Among earliest [[domestication|domesticated]]
			1. Herd-oriented
			2. Not self-domesticated
				- Intentional [[domestication]]
			3. Smaller
			4. Lots of product
				- Meat, fiber, leather
		- Terms
			1. Parturition = lambing 
			2. Intact male = ram
			3. Castrated male = wether
			4. Female = ewe
			5. Young male = ram lamb
			6. Young female = ewe lamb
			7. All young = lambs
		- Mouflon
			1. Ancestor of all sheep
			2. Developed domesticated sheep from wild mouflon
		- Reproduction
			1. Seasonal breeders
				- Short day breeders
				- Only have estrous cycles as light decreases and darkness increases over a 24 hr period
					1. Fall/winter in northern hemisphere
						- Dec 21 is the equinox (NH) and the peak
					2. Anestrous = without estrus
						- Spring/summer in northern hemisphere
			1. Normally 17 day estrous cycle
			2. Estrus = 30 hours
			3. Gestation = 147 days
				- Lambing in spring as forage starts growing
			4. Puberty = 6-8 months
			5. Life cycle
				- Day 0 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
				- Day 147 (lambing from Mar to Apr)
					1. Castration of most males
					2. Young animal vaccinations 
				- Day 200 (weaning from May to June)
					1. Weaning = Process of separation of the dam and offspring  
				- Day 260 (market lambs from July to Aug for meat producing animals)
					1. Market lambs = lambs sold to meat market
					2. Around July or August
					3. Meat lambs, not wool lambs
					4. Get rid of castrated males and most of ewe lambs
						- Must keep some for breeding
				- Day 365 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
					1. Cycle repeats
		- Types of sheep
			1. Wool
				- Diameter of wool fiber (17-40 microns)
					1. Fine wool = smaller diameter
					2. Human hair is 40-300 microns
						- Extremally small compared to humans
				- 150-250 lbs.
					1. Not large compared to meat breeds
				- Midwest and West
					1. Too humid in the South
						- Can handle heat, but humidity is devastating 
					2. Many parasites in hot + humid environments like the South
				- Can be eaten, but not as prosperous/nice
				- Bred to not have pigmentation in hair (sorta translucent)
					1. Can be easily dyed 
				- Navaho-Churro
				- Rambouillet
					1. French breed
					2. Moderate size
				- Romney
					1. English breed
					2. Very long hair
			2. Meat
				- Often called farm flock
				- Selected for carcass and growth characteristic
				- Medium quality wool
					1. Greater diameter (not as fine)
				- 250-400 lbs.
				- Midwest and Northeast
				- Suffolk
				- Hampshire
				- Can have black pigmentation
					1. Limits dying ability
				- Shear in the spring but toss wool
					1. Only for cooling/sheep comfort 
				- Southdown 
			3. Hair Breeds
				- Meat
				- Milk
				- Leather
				- Subtropical to tropical environment
					1. Selected for parasite, disease resistance
					2. Adapted to hot, humid environment
				- Barbados blackbelly
				- Katahdin
					1. What we have
					3. Gulf coast natives
						- From Katahdin
						- Southeast
					4. 1957 - Maine - Three lines of African based hair breeds via Virgin Islands
						- Bred in virgin islands then brought to northeast
					5. Treat once every 8-15 months based off need
			4. Diversity
				- Jacob sheep
					1. 4-8 Big horns
				- Shetland
					1. Small and fluffy
				- Han
					1. Small tail han
					2. Large tail han (fat tail)
						- Tail is delicacy 
				- Many other different breeds
		- Wool Production
			1. Wool Fiber
				- Cuticle
					1. Like overlapping scales of a snake
					2. Outside cover w/ barbs and scale-like projections
					3. Can weave fiber together bc the barbs interlock
						- Felting = Process of weaving fibers together
				- Cortex
					1. Internal area w/ spongy material
					2. Spongy and semi hollow
					3. Absorbs dyes easily
					4. Great insulation
						- Trapping warm air 
				- Regular hair is just strands of protein smashed together
					1. Smooth on outside
					2. Does not dye easily and does not hold together well
				- Corse wool
					1. Larger diameter
					2. Bigger barbs on cuticle so not as nice to wear
						- Itchy 
					3. Carpets 
						- Carpet burn - sratchy
				- Fine wool
					1. Smaller diameter
					2. Smaller barbs so more comfortable
				- Silk
					1. No barbs 
					2. Very hard to hold together
					3. Silkworms are one of very few domesticated insects
					4. Smaller than fine wool
				- Cotton
					1. Can be weaved easily cause of edges
			2. Quality of wool
				- Fiber diameter
					1. Smaller more favorable
					2. The larger the diameter, the less we use it for
					3. 1/2 blood, 3/8 blood, 1/4 blood, low 1/4 blood, common/braid
						- More good wool sheep blood = smaller diameter and better quality
					4. CPI = Crimps per inch
						- Waves of wool fiber
						- The more waves, the better
							1. More waves in finer wool
						- Higher CPI is better quality
						- More crimps also makes it stretchy

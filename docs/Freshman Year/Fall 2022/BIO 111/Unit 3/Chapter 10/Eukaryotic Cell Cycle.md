1. [[Cell Reproduction]]
	- 4 major parts (First three (G1, S, G2) are part of interphase)
		1. G1 (gap phase 1)
			- Primary growth phase
			- Longest phase
		3. S (synthesis)
			- DNA replication when you make your second copy
		4. G2 (gap phase 2)
			- Organelles replicate and microtubules organize
		5. M (mitosis)
			- Only time when chromosomes packaged so tight that they are visible to microscope
			- The division of the nucleus
			- Subdivided into 5 phases
		6.  C (cytokinesis)
			- Separation of 2 new cells
		7. Cells spend most of their life in interphase
			- G1, S2 or G2
			- Very short time spend in M phase when division of nucleus to make two cells occur
		8. Duration
			- Time it takes to complete a [[Cell]] cycle varies greatly
			- Fruit fly embryos = 8 min
				1. Very rapid cell cycle
				2. More quickly than binary fission (~ 20 mins)
				3. Bacteria has about 4000 genes while fruit fly has about 15000
					- Both have DNA polymerase (enzyme for division)
					- If bacterial [[Cell]] has [[DNA]] polymerase that is 10x faster than eukaryote, how is fruit fly faster?
						1. Plasmid has one origin of replication (one starting point)
						2. Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication (can start at multiple points) so can occur more rapidly 
						3. Not necessarily all eukaryotic cells are fast however
			- Mature cells take longer to grow
				1. Typical mammalian cell takes 24 hours
				2. Liver [[Cell]] takes more than a year
				3. If [[Cell]] doesn't divide, it spends is life in G0
					- Ex: neurons
					- Resting phase - cells spend most of life here
			9. Growth occurs during G1, G2, and S phases (interphase)
		- Cell cycle consists of interphase and miotic phase. During interphase, cell grows and nuclear [[DNA]] is duplicated. Interphase followed by miotic phase in which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Cytoplasm divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells
			1. All uses cellular communication
				- Intracellular 
		- Mitosis
			1. Prophase = when chromosomes condense and become visible
				- Spindle fibers emerge from centrosomes 
				- Nuclear envelope (membrane) breaks down
				- Nucleolus disappears
				- Pro = "beginning" or "first"
			2. Prometaphase
				- Chromosomes further condense 
				- Miotic spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores 
				- Centrosomes move toward opposite poles
				- Kinetochores appear at centrosomes
			3. Metaphase
				- Miotic spindle is fully developed and centrosomes are at opposite poles of [[Cell]]
				- Chromosomes lined up at metaphase plate
				- Each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle fiber originating from opposite poles
			1. Anaphase
				- Cohesion proteins binding to sister chromatids together break down
				- Sister chromatids (now called chromosomes) are pulled towards opposite poles
					1. Pulled apart at centromere
					2. Arms are trailing behind centromere as it is pulled
				- Non-kinetochore spindle fibers lengthen, elongating the cell
			2. Telophase
				- Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense
				- Nuclear envelope material surrounds each set of chromosomes
				- The spindle breaks down
		- Cytokinesis
			1. After mitosis
			2. Occurs in animal cells
				- Ring of actin filaments from at the metaphase plate
					1. Ring contracts, forming a cleavage furrow, which divides the cell in two
		- Plant [[Cell]] division
			1. Forms cell plate from secretions of carbohydrates (cellulose)
			2. Created in middle of dividing cell
	- Centromere - point of constriction
		1. Like trailer hitch 
			- Attachment site for microtubules
		2. Sister chromatids
			- Separated and pulled in different directions during anaphase
		3. Mitotic spindle microtubules
			- Like railways
			- Very gently curving but mostly straight
			- Kinetochores bind to a motor [[Protein]], walks on microtubules to transport sister chromatid
2. Control of the [[Cell]] cycle
	- Checkpoints
		1. Cell cycle has two irreversible points
			- Replication of genetic material
			- Separation of the sister chromatids 
		2. Cell cycle can be put on hold at specific points called checkpoints
			- Process is checked for accuracy and can be halted if there are errors
			- Allows [[Cell]] to respond to internal and external signals
			- G1/S checkpoint
				1. At the end of G1
				2. Are there all the necessary resources ([[Energy]] and monomers?)
					- If yes, moves on to S
				3. Primary point for external signal influence
				4. Cell "decides" to divide
					- Each strand of DNA then copied
					- 23 pairs of chromosomes before S phase
					- After S phase, temporarily double that (48 pairs)
			- G2/M checkpoint
				1. [[Cell]] makes commitment to mitosis
				2. Assesses success of [[DNA]] replication
					- If [[DNA]] damaged, goes back to be fixed
						1. UV light can damage DNA
						2. Some chemicals can damage DNA
			- Late metaphase (spindle) checkpoint
				1. [[Cell]] ensures that all chromosomes are attached to the spindle
					- At this point, visible and tightly packed
					- Chromosomes lined up but must check that they are properly hitched and will be pulled in the right direction
		3. Three checkpoints asses integrity of [[DNA]] (G1 checkpoint), proper chromosome duplication (G2 checkpoint), and the attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber (M checkpoint)
	- How do you control the checkpoints?
		1. Series of [[Protein|proteins]] called cyclins
			- Different types of cyclins
			- Periods of high concentrations that drop off to low concentrations
				1. Rises then falls at different points
				2. Cyclin E rises after G1 Phase then drops at S Phase
				3. Cyclin D steadily rises from G1 then peaks at S Phase then gone after Mitosis
				4. Cyclin A rises after S phase then drops before Mitosis
				5. Cyclin B rises after S phase then drops a little after Cyclin A
			- Ubiquinone = can be put on a cyclin and marks it for degradation
				1. When proteins ubiqicated, they are marked for degradation
				2. After cyclins ubiqicated, concentration levels drop bc they are destroyed
			- Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) = [[Protein]] [[Cell Communication|kinases]] that can phosphorylate and activate cyclins 
				1. Cyclin levels elevate, then CDK activates it to advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint
				2. Changes tertiary structure when phosphorylated
				3. To become fully activated, a CDK must bind to a cyclin [[Protein]] then be phosphorylated by another kinase

^1675383860613

Recombination::Formation of new combination of genes on a chromosome as a result of crossing over

^1675383860631

Additive gene action::The effect of one gene adds to the effect of another gene to determine the phenotype; Seen w/ quantitative traits; Expression over continuous range of values; Each gene contributes a certain amount towards phenotypic expression; Ex: Milk Production, Carcass Merit
^1675383860637

Heritability (h^2)::The proportion of genes expected to be passed from parent to offspring that contribute to the expression of that trait; h^2 is a measure of *additive gene action*
^1675383860643

Broad sense heritability::h^2 = Vg / Vp = (Vbv + Vgcv) / (Vg + Ve); Not as reliable as narrow sense heritability bc contains gene combination value; The ratio of genotypic variance to phenotypic variance 
^1675383860649

Narrow sense heritability::h^2 = Vbv / Vp; Measure of the strength of the relationship between performance (phenotypic value) and breeding values for a trait in a population; Better to use than broad sense heritability
^1675383860654

If a trait is highly heritable, animals w/ high performance tend to produce ---::high performing offspring and vise versa; If trait not very heritable, performance records of parents reveals little about progeny performance
^1675383860660

Levels of heritability::High = 0.41-0.99, Medium = 0.21-0.4, Low = 0.01-0.2
^1675383860666

HWE Definition::In a large, randomly mating population, gene/allelic and genotypic frequencies will remain *constant* from generation to generation in the absence of mutation, migration, genetic drift, selection, and recombination.
^1675524043885

HWE Frequency Equations::Allelic: p + q = 1; Genotypic: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
^1675524043895

The HWE is based on --- principles::Mendel's; By G. H. Hardy (1877-1947) and Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937); Hardy and Weinberg independently devised the same equation
^1675524043902

In HWE, the population will be in equilibrium if not disrupted by ---::evolutionary forces; Most populations do not completely follow HWE assumptions (No genetic drift, No mutation, No recombination, No selection, Large, sexually reproducing population);  These are all mechanisms acting within populations, an occurrence called "population genetics" - *except* for epigenetic modifications, which act on individuals in a Lamarckian manner
^1675524043910

Requirements of HW::Large pop size, Random mating, No mutations, No migration, No natural selection
^1675524043917

Violation of HWE (Evolution)::Genetic Drift, Inbreeding and nonrandom mating, Mutations, Migration, Natural Selection
^1675524043925

Testing for HWE can be used to assess whether a population is ---::evolving; Are you making progress w/ your crosses?; A pop that is *not* evolving shows allele and genotypic frequencies that are in HWE; If a pop isn't in HWE, it can be concluded that the pop is evolving (Frequencies will not remain constant from generation to generation)
^1675524043932

Population::A group of individuals within a species that is capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring; Interbreed + fertile offspring
^1675524043940

According to the HW principle, frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a pop remain ---::constant from generation to generation; In a given pop where gametes contribute to the next generation randomly, allele frequencies will not change; Follows the transmission rules of Mendelian inheritance, which maintains constant proportions in a pop across generations

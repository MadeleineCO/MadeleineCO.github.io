The goal of a living organism is to go from ---::gene to protein; For ex: gfp (gene) --> GFP (Green Florescent Protein), bla (gene) --> BLA (protein; BLA gene expressed as ampicillin resistance)
^1668703248553

Transcription (biol)::Copying info from DNA to RNA; Complementary base pairs (but NO thymine in RNA (uracil instead)); Takes place in nucleus
^1668703264111

RNA polymerase is the enzyme that ---:: "reads" the *template strand* of DNA in order to produce mRNA during transcription
^1668703248565

Template strand::Strand of DNA that mRNA reads to eventually get translated; (coding strand = the other strand of DNA)
^1668703248571

Translation (biol)::Using info from mRNA to create amino acid sequence (ex protein); Occurs in cytoplasm in ribosomes; Proceeds from 5' --> 3' ends
^1668703264121

mRNA reads 3 letters at a time in units called ---::*codons*; Each codon represents 20 amino acid possibilities
^1668703248581

Transformation::The insertion of a gene from one organism to another organism; GMO = genetically modified organism; The inserted gene causes the 2nd organism to be "transformed" as it now expresses the inserted gene; Ex: bacteria can be transformed to produce insulin; Accomplished using a *plasmid* in prokaryotes
^1668703248587

Our Experiment::Insert one gene from a jellyfish (gfp) and another gene for ampicillin resistance (bla) into E. coli (type of bacteria); Note: gfp gene only glows when in presence of sugar arabinose (ara); Took two cultures of E. coli bacteria and attempted to transform one (the experimental group) while leaving other as is (the control group)
^1668703248594

We did not know which one was transformed (A culture or B culture?) so allowed both cultures to grow over a week (food = agar) then saw which one ---::grew despite ampicillin and which one glowed in presence of ara
^1668703248601

Plate LB (liquid broth; no ara, no ampicillin)::E. coli A grew but did not glow; E. coli B grew but did not glow
^1668703248608

Plate LB w/ ara (no ampicillin)::A grew but did not glow; B grew and glowed
^1668703248614

Plate LB w/ amp (no ara)::A did not grow or glow; B grew but did not glow
^1668703248625

Plate LB w/ amp and ara::A did not grow or glow; B grew and glowed
^1668703248631

Experiment Conclusion::A was the control group bc it never glowed (even in ara presence) and did not grow in presence of amp; B was the transformed group bc it glowed in the presence of ara (due to gfp gene) and grew in the presence of amp (due to bla gene)

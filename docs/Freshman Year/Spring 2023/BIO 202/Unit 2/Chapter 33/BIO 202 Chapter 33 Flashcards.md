Diffusion and Size/Growth::Removing salt costs ATP whereas H2O regulation is free (ATP pump vs osmosis); Relates SA to Volume ratio in cells
^1677950104241

SA to Volume ratio in cells::Volume increases at a faster rate than SA; Cells have to be fairly small to allow diffusion; Cells have such high SA relative to their volume that they can readily diffuse; The bigger the cell, the more specialized pieces you need to allow function (loses ability for things to get to center of cell just by diffusion); Diffusion distance linked w/ cell size

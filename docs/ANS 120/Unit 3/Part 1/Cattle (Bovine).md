1. [[Domestication]]
	- Later than [[sheep and goats]]
		1. Became associated with wealth
			- Could be reason for domestication
			- Not as practical because large and dangerous
	- Bred for meat, [[Dairy]], draft
			1. Some bred for different environments
	- Great Aurock = original ancestor of cattle
	- Intentional domestication (NOT self-domestication)
	- Formation of breeds
		1. Intentional selection to create breeds
			- Robert Bakewell = Breed development
				1. Father of animal breeding
				2. 1725-1795
				3. Point where selective breeding began
					- Selective Breeding
						1. Must define traits of interest
						2. Selection --> like to like (inbreeding)
						3. Evaluate the offspring for selection of the next generation
							- Requires recordkeeping 
							- Found ideal bulls then gave them to others w/ the stipulation that he could choose offspring
				1. Developed shire/draft horse
				2. Dishley Longhorn
2. [[Herbivores]]
3. [[Dairy]] 
	- 5 major breeds
		1. Ayrshire
			- From Scotland
			- 12,000 lbs. of [[Milk]]
			- 6% fat
		2. Brown Swiss
			- From Switzerland
			- 17,000 lbs. of milk
		3. Guernsey
			- From Isle of Guernsey
			- 15,000 lbs.
			- 5% fat
			- Orange [[Milk]] = orange [[Cheese]]
		4. Holstein
			- From Netherlands
			- 25,000 lbs.
			- 3.5% fat
		5. Jersey
			- From Isle of Jersey
			- 15,000 lbs. of milk
			- 5% fat
		6. Holstein nums have increased and are main producers. Jerseys are second, but nums have dramatically decreased in favor of Helsteins
			- Why >85% Holsteins?
				1. How a producer is paid - pounds of [[Milk]], then pounds of fat, and lastly protein content
				2. Holstein produces 10,000 more lbs of milk than Jersey. Holsteirn has 3.5% fat while Jersey has 5% fat, but 25,000/3.5% is 875 lbs of fat while 15,000/5% is 750 lbs of fat.
				3. Holstein provides more lbs. of [[Milk]] and more fat.
	- As milk production goes up, percent fat goes down per pound
	- 90% fluid milk
	- 24,000 lbs/305 day lactation
		- Pounds, not gallons
		- 24,000 lbs. / 8.8lbs./gallon = 2,730 gallons/cow  
		- 2,730 gallons / 305days = 8.9 gallons/day
2. Agriculture Cooperative (Ag Co-ops)
	- Legalized Monopolies
	- Control production, processing, and distribution
	- Western, S Central, W NC, E NC, S Atlantic, and N Atlantic
	- Must be part of Ag Co-op to sell [[Milk]] for commercial purposes
		1. Must buy shares and can sell up to the num of shares you have
	- Can get around it by processing it yourself and then selling it on the farm
		1. Other way to get around it is selling it for non-human purposes (pet milk)
3. [[Milk]]

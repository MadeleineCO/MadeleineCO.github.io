1. The Problem of Evil
	1. Natural Evil
		1. Tornadoes, disease, chaos, disorder, etc.
		2. Are these bad or are people just in wrong place at wrong time?
		3. Results of the natural world
	2. Moral Evil
		1. Caused by humans
		2. Usually directly related to the problem of evil
		3. Key question - why do innocents suffer? Is God all-loving and all-powerful?
			1. Evil is a problem, not a doctrine
				1. There is doctrine about sin
				2. Evil does not seem to fit in a "good" creation governed by a sovereign God who is love
2. Dimensions of the Problem
	1. Experiential force
		1. Pain and suffering - we feel it
	2. Intellectual conundrum
		1. Humans inclined not to accept but to ask “why” concerning evil
		2. Why do we do such things?
			1. Do all creatures wonder if things should be different or just humans?
	3. Epicurus (c. 4th century BC): ancient Greek philosopher
		1. Thought that it was Impossible that 1) god is all-powerful, 2) God is all-good, and 3) evil exists
		2. He did not know the biblical concerning the fall of humanity
			1. Or what Jesus has done about it
	4. David Hume (18th century): Scottish philosopher
		1. Did know about Bible
		2. Made question of evil more well-known
	5. Evil is a problem for any worldview, religious or non-religious
		1. What do we do?
		2. How should we feel about it?
3. Theodicy Project
	1. Coined by Leibniz (German philosopher)
	2. Theodicy -> theos + dike (justice)
	3. Attempt to "justify" God as both good and powerful in the face of evil
	4. Theodicy throughout history
		1. 20th century
			1. 19th century—optimism, idol of progress
				1. Industry and technology will fix all problems
				2. Science will provide all answers (i.e. Titanic)
			2. Great War—WWI—the “war to end all wars” (1914 – 1918)
			3. WWII (1939 – 1945)—50 million people killed, genocide (Jewish Holocaust)
			4. Followed by Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Sudan, etc…Ireland
			5. Great disillusionment 
				1. Technology and science helps kill and has terrible effects on world
				2. Humans aren't getting better
	5. Theodicies of the West
		1. Explanations for evil offered long before the term was even coined
		2. Evil is inherent in the material world
			1. Around 2nd century AD
			2. Borrowed from Plato
		3. Gnosticism—dualism of spirit and matter (evil)
			1. Matter created by the Demiurge—a lesser god
			2. Salvation—escape from material world through special gnosis—discover one’s me-ness with God
		4. Evil as non-being
			1. Plotinus (3rd century AD) created Neoplatonism—monistic (only one real thing in the world)
				1. Transcendent God/Supreme Being
				2. Evil is not real—the unfortunate location of being at the edges of Divine Being
					1. Farther you get away from transcendent being, the more darkness
					2. Like Darkness—absence of light
					3. Merely a privation of goodness
		5. Evil as a necessary condition for Human becoming/development
			1. Made popular by John Hick—“soul-building” Theodicy
				1. Rooted in Irenaeus - 2nd century Christian
			2. Humans created good, not perfect, and still immature. 
				1. Need to make “good” decisions to become mature. 
				2. Thus, evil is a necessary condition for humanity to be able to choose rightly
		6. Evil and cosmic beauty
			1. In the end, evil will become an aesthetic theodicy
			2. Evil plays a role in God’s creation
				1. At the end, we will see and appreciate the full picture of history as a beautiful portrait. 
				2. Evil contributes (creates compassion, healing, etc.)
		7. Evil and submission to divine will (submission theodicy)
			1. All events must fit somehow into God’s plan and goodness
			2. Humans should not complain but learn in submissive receptivity
			3. Associated w/ Compatibilists (like John Calvin)—God ordains all things in a manner compatible with human choices and responsibility—and incompatibility
				1. One can only trust God in the face of evil. Cannot really be “explained” beyond that. Trust God’s good sovereignty to prevail
4. Theological Response to the Problem of Evil
	1. Some of these “capture a moment of truth”
		1. Can find biblical text to support various ideas but not fully sufficient
	2. Job—locus classicus; evil, suffering and justice vs. “wisdom”
		1. Highlights the problem
		2. Job is righteous person so why is he suffering?
	3. Habakkuk 1-2:1, 2:4—the righteous will live by faith in the midst of evil
		1. Should trust God
		2. Any full answer to the problem of evil and divine justice is pending—still an open question (what is our capacity for understanding an answer)
			1. Bible mostly teaches response 
			3. Would we even understand full answer?
				1. Ex. Me with my children
	4. Theodicy project = a problem itself
		1. Attempts at a definitive answer impossible (only glimpses of truth)\
		2. Attempts to justify God, but ends up justifying evil by giving evil a positive role in God’s creation
		3. Elie Wiesel (Night—The Trial of God)
			1. See Sam’s summation, ends up being Satan
				1. Theodicies can be diabolical
			2. No glib or easy answers, cannot justify or trivialize unjust suffering
		4. “free-will” defense
			1. Defense vs. theodicy
				1. Defense defends why God is still God
					2. Possible answer
				2. Theodicy tries to form answer to problem
					1. Definitive answer
		5. God gave humans a free-will to choose good or bad. “morally free”—a condition for evil, not its cause
			1. Free will does not cause evil but allows for the possibility
		6. Origin of evil
			1. Still a mystery
			2. Human evil comes from misuse of creaturely freedom
				1. Acting against what we know is right
			3. Bible not concerned to answer this but to address the reality of it
			4. Both a humanity problem and a personal problem
			5. Cannot be blamed on God, creation, or even the devil
5. The Present and future of “evil”
	1. Evil may be understood in light of God’s history of the salvation of the world (Redemption History)
	2. Good Friday: Trinity and the Cross
		1. Jesus enters human condition to save/redeem from within
		2. Cross = ultimate injustice and rejection of God
		3. God’s compassion and willingness to suffer with us
			1. Wolterstorf: “why do you permit yourself to suffer, O God?”
	3. Easter Sunday: Resurrection and New Creation
		1. Death/suffering/evil do not have last word
			1. Jesus is victorious over all these things
			2. New, indestructible life
				1. Raised to incorruptible and eternal life
		2. Post tenebras lux
		3. Evil defeated/Jesus vindicated = promise of new ceration which comes at the end = final judgment, resurrection, new creation, no evil
		4. WWII analogy: 6/6/44 = DDay, 5/8/45 = VE Day
			1. Decisive victory day - Jesus' ressurection
			2. Final victory day came later 
			3. Had to continue war in-between but end in sight
			4. Between the already and the not yet
		5. Holy Saturday: lament, protest, Hope
			1. In-between day sorta like times we are in now
			2. Name and shame evil for what it is
			3. Live in shadow of cross with promise of new life only partially realized
			4. Remembrance, anticipation, appropriation
			5. Reject, affirm, redeem
			7. Protest: echoing god’s own heart à becomes prayer, transformation and action
				1. Can lament sin as we are in the not yet
				2. Lament: Psalm 22, 44, 88 à Bible gives us words
			8. Anthropodicy—how do we justify the evil we cause as humans
	4. We have hope of new life and new world
		1. See Moltmann and Wright for good theological resources on hope
			1. Stress that evil not intrinsic to creation
			2. Evil is a perversion and parasite that will be removed for new life in a new world.
		2. Page 225 - “The resurrection of Jesus Christ promises this radical surgery in a renewed heaven and earth, the re-creation of all things
		3. Conel: “The Word spoken to creation in the incarnation defeated the powers (including evil) on Easter Sunday and will consummate his cosmic rule in the last days.”
		4. See Revelation 21 :)
			1. No more crying or suffering
		5. What if for the present, the question is turned around on us? 
			1. If you’re so good, why so much evil? 
			2. If you’re filled with God’s spirit, why does it still exist?

Aerobic Respiration::Requires oxygen; Animals eat sugar and breath oxygen, expelling carbon dioxide and water and gaining energy
^1663201177570

Aerobic Respiration Formula::$C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}\rightarrow 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy$
^1663201177579

Photosynthesis::Most life forms on earth get energy from sun (plants capture sunlight and herbivores eat plants then carnivores eat herbivores and decomposers digest plant and animal matter)
^1663201177585

Photosynthesis formula::$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$ (Same formula as aerobic respiration but in reverse)
^1663201177592

Metabolism::Total of all chemical reactions carried out by an organism (Anabolic = expanding energy to build up molecules) (Catabolic = harvesting energy by breaking down molecules)
^1663201177600

Digestion::Breaking down protein to amino acids and complex sugars to simple sugars
^1663201177608

Biochemical pathways::Reactions occur in a sequence and the product of one reaction is the substrate for the next; Many steps take place in organelles

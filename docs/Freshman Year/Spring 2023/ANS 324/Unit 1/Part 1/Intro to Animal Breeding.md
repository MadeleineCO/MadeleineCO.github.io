1.  The science of genetics
	1. Interaction of genes and environment
	2. Study of *heredity and variation*, seeking to discover laws governing similarities and differences in individuals related by decent
2. Animal breeding
	1. Animal genetics = study of the principles of inheritance in animals
	2. Animal breeding = application of principles of animal genetics with the goal of improvement in animals
		1. Select animals that are more efficient under assumption they will move mean of population towards your goal
	3. Purpose of animal breeding = *improve* genetically the economici efficiencies of livestock production
		1. Less feed is more ideal. Better water usage. More product.
		2. Livestock improvement?
			1. Change!
				1. Ex: change in performance
				2. Change over time using *selection*
	4. Selection = determination of the parents of the next generation
		1. Main tool in genetic improvement of economic merit
		2. Can be natural or artificial
			1. Selection (in this course) refers to man-made (artificial) selection
			2. Natural selection selects for size, strength, intelligence, color, defense strategies, flexibility, longevity (more time to reproduce)
				2. Genetic fitness
		3. Selection can have positively correlated traits or negatively correlated traits
			1. Increases/decreases together or one increases while other decreases
	5. Domestication
		1. First animal to be domesticated was dog
			1. Self-domestication
				1. Dogs were attracted to food sources around humans so they get more used to human activity
				2. Become tamer over time
			2. Intentional (Human) domestication
				1. When humans seek out animals to domesticate 
				2. A human could have taken baby wolves home and humans select the tamest offspring
		2. What did domestication do for civilization?
			1. Increased availability of resources
			2. More time to focus on other activities bc more resources
			3. Domestication allowed civilization to happen bc people could then create settlements
			4. Animals serve as insurance during times of drought
		3. The order of domestication
			1. Dog
			2. Sheep and goats
			3. Cattle and ---
			4. Llama and horses
			5. Camels and cats
			6. Chickens
			7. Guinea pig
			8. Turkey
			9. Rabbit
			10. Lab mammals
	6. Robert Bakewell (1725-1795)
		1. Father of Animal Breeding
		2. English geneticist that mated cattle, sheep, and horses
		3. Developed the purebred concept
			1. "In and in" mating system
				1. Idea that we should keep breeds pure by *inbreeding*
					1. Inbreeding mates individuals that are more closely related than the average of the population
					2. Increases homozygosity
						1. Homozygous means carrying the same type of allele
					3. Improves uniformity
						1. More uniform in size, color, etc.
				2. Didn't believe in crossbreeding
		4. Breeding process
			1. Set goals
			2. Developed early bull *progeny test*
				1. Progeny = offspring
				2. Progeny testing evaluates the performance of the offspring by assessing the parent
				3. Looked at offspring to rank bulls
				4. Ex: milk yield
					1. We focus on the males bc they can breed many females and have many offspring
						1. Males drive genetic improvement
						2. Progeny test creates expectations for offspring
						3. Milk yield progeny test creates expectations for female offspring of the bull
							1. Males carry gene for milk yield but do not express it
							2. The more daughters the progeny test can look at, the better the assessment of future offspring
					2. Bull A
						1. Mated w/ ten cows
							1. Mate at 12-15 months
							2. First progeny at 2 yrs
						2.  Offspring of ten cows
						3. Take avg of milk yield from 1st progeny group
					3. Bull B
						1. Same process as Bull A
					4. Bull C
						1. Same process as Bull A
					5. Compare the bulls offspring to see which is your best bull
						1. Collect semen from the best
					6. By the time you finish testing, bulls may be about 5 yrs old
						1. Need time for accurate predictions
			3. Developed record system
				1. Must keep records of breed averages
	7. Breed Development
		1. Process: Self domestication/Human Intervention
			1. Stage 1: Selection for tameness
			2. Stage 2: Strict captivity - limit breeding
			3. Stage 3: Intentional breeding
			4. Stage 4: Trait standardization
				1. Inbreeding fixes traits in a population
					1. Limits variation
				2. Ex: black coat, long floppy ears, etc.
			5. Stage 5: Eliminate wild species (genes)
				1. Don't allow animals carrying undesirable traits to reproduce
		2. Process: Human Domestication/Human Intervention
			1. Stage 1: Control herd movement
			2. Stage 2: Eliminate "problems"
			3. Stage 3: Selection for tameness
			4. Stage 4: Strict captivity - limit breeding
			5. Stage 5: Intentional breeding
			6. Stage 6: Trait standardization
			7. Stage 7: Eliminate wild species (genes)

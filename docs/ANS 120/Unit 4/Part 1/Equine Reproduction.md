1. [[Horse (Equine)]]
	- Seasonal Breeders (Long Day)
		1. Peak on the summers equinox in northern hemisphere 
		2. Most are bred before we get to June bc starting in spring
	- 21 day estrous cycle
	- 5-7 day estrus
	- Ovulation occurs about 24-48 hrs before end of estrus
	- 335 day gestation
		1. Can vary some
	- Very short parturition bc of diffuse attachment
		1. 17 min and placenta gone by about an hour
		2. Front feet go first and horse repositions fetus
		3. The quicker the parturition, the less vulnerable
		4. Foal will be up within hour and gets colostrum
			- Mare produces lots of milk but has small udder bc foal nurses often
	- Cycle
		1. Day 0 = breeding (may)
		2. Day 335 = foaling (april)
			- Foal heat occurs 9-14 day postpartum
				1. About 40% of mares will demonstrate estrus at this time
				2. Of that 40%, about 40% will get pregnant if bred by the male
					- Less likely to get pregnant but most breeders try to get horses pregnant then to save a month or two
				3. Shorter estrus (1-3 days)
				4. Purpose of foal heat is to increase estrogen (increases blood flow to uterus, more white blood cells, more nutrients --> more tissue repair) to help the uterine involution process 
					- Enhances rate of uterine involution
					- For repair, not reproduction
			- At least 60 days for return to normal estrous cycles bc of long gestation, uterine involution, and lactational anestrous 
		3. Day 390 = normal cycling (may/june at the earliest)
			- Cannot breed a horse once a year
	- Horses have lowest reproduction rate ([[Female Reproduction]])
		1. Physiological reasons for low repro
			- Long gestation slows down reproduction
			- Long day breeder (seasonal)
			- Single offspring
			- Long time to reach puberty and maturity
		2. Artificial reasons
			- Result from human-induced problems
			- We want competition horses to come earlier in year bc they all fall under same birth year so more time for training and growth
				1. All foals born between Jan 1 - Dec 31 are all same age relative to competition 
					- Earlier is better for competition purposes and horses born earlier in year tend to have an advantage
						1. More developed
						2. More training
					- Long day breeders but would be best for us of bred in Feb so baby is born in Jan
						1. Don't start estrus until later in spring (begin about march-may and peak on june 21)
						2. Most breeders try to start in Feb than stop in Jun
							- Start when they don't want to breed but stop when they do want to breed
							- Try to breed during transition from anestrous to having normal estrous cycles
							- Stop in early summer bc they would be born to late
						3. Light barn = trying to mimic light to start estrous cycles earlier
							- Very difficult and expensive
				1. Not bred based on reproduction
					- Based on performance
					- If animals have repro issues, we don't select against them
						1. Not eliminating problems

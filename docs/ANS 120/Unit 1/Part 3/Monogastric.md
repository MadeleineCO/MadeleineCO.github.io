I. [[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]]
	A. Single chambered stomach
II. [[Carnivores]] and [[Omnivores]]
	A. Have differences in intestines (mainly length)
	B. Carnivore is shorter and omnivore is longer
III. Digestive system
	A. Begins with mastication
		- Mechanical digestion/breakdown in mouth
		- Chewing to create a bolus (creates wad the perfect size of our esophagus)
	B. Esophagus
		- Transport of ingested material from the mouth to the stomach
		- One-way system
			A. Down
			B. Goes opposite way when body says its better to get it out than try to digest
				a. Burns the esophagus because of acid
				b. Happens due to a number of physiological conditions
	C. Gastric Stomach
		- Chemical digestion
			a. Acids - "sour"
				i. pH = "Power of Hydrogen"
					~ Rated 0-14
					~ 7 is considered neutral
						~ Blood, water
					~ See chart ([[Digestive A&P - pH.png]])
				ii. When mixed with water, an acid yields H+ ions
			b. Bases - "bitter"
				i. When mixed with water, bases yield OH- ions
			c. We have protective layers of mucus in the stomach to protect us from acid
				i. Chemical digestion, no absorption, in stomach 
				ii. Mucous cells: secrete an alkaline mucus that protects the epithelium against sheer stress and acid
				iii. Parietal cells: secrete hydrochloric acid
				iii. Chief cells: secrete pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme
				iv. G cells: secrete the hormone gastrin
					~ Tells you when you're full
	D. Small intestines: transfers nutrients across small intestine wall into circulatory system
		- Make materials mixed with acid more neutral
		- Proximal region: closest region to the stomach
			a. Mostly still chemical digestion
				i. No strong acids
					~ Bile is secreted here
						~ Milder than acid but still used for breakdown
			b. Some absorption
		- Distal region: second region farther away from stomach
			i. Mostly nutrient absorption
			ii. Lots of blood supply to intestines 
				~ Absorbed into circulatory nutrients
	E. Large intestine
		- May include the cecum (caecum) 
			a. "Blind pouch"
			b. Digestive material sits in the cecum
			c. Most monogastrics do not have a functional cecum
				i. If nonfunctional {does not have microbial activity), it is called an appendix
				ii. Often bypasses cecum
				iii. If nutrients and bacteria and fecal matter get stuck in appendix, it swells and must be removed
					~ If it bursts, you get massive abdominal issues
			d. If it is functional, it is good for microbial digestion and called a cecum
				i. Bacteria, yeast, fungi, protozoa
				ii. [[Pig (Porcine)]] do have functional cecum
		- Includes the large colon (large intestines)
			a. Some nutrient absorption
			b. Mostly water metabolism
				i. We don't want to keep all the water we intake
				ii. Designed to maintain the appropriate amount of water
					~ Generally retained
				iii. Water is also used for transport of feces, but by this point the process is finished
				iv. Cholera affects water metabolism and creates diarrhea 
					~ Uncontrolled water loss
IV. [[Avian]]/Modified Monogastric
	A. Very different from other monogastric animals

1. [[Dog (Canine)]]
	- Anatomy of the Eye
		1. Cornea = acts a a lens (bends light) and protects eye
		2. Pupil = regulates amount of light (constricts and dilates)
		3. Lens = bends light to focus on back
		4. Retina = contains rods and cones
			- Rods = only operate low light vision
			- Cones = color
				1. Humans are trichomic (short, middle, long)
				2. Dogs are dichromic
					- Mostly blues and earth tones
					- See more ultraviolet light (lower frequency)
			- Dogs have more rods and fewer cones
				1. They have better low light vision than humans
		5. Tapetum = reflective layer behind retina that can reflect and amplify light
			- Some breeds don't have tapetums (usually dogs that work in snow/ice)
			- Pupil can regulate amount of light
		6. Visual Acuity
			- The ability to focus
			- Dogs have 1-2 diopters
				1. Limited accommodation 
				2. Karioscope can look at back of eye (around retina). Stain looks at scratches on cornea.
					- Helps us examine dog vision
					- Discrimination test = can train dog to look at bars and if far away, looks like a grey box. Teach dog that grey box = this and bars = that.
						1. Most dogs are 20/75 (what they see at 20 feet, we can see at 75)
						2. Have trouble seeing far away
						3. Myopic = nearsighted
						4. Emmetropic = neutral
						5. Hyperopic = Farsighted
						6. Not all dogs are nearsighted. Guide dogs tend to be hyperopic or emmetropic. (ex retrievers). Same w/ sight hounds (ex greyhounds)
						7. Wolves are neutral to slightly myopic
			- Humans = 20/20
				1. 1st num is how far away you can see something
				2. 2nd num is how far away avg person can see something
				3. Nearsighted vs farsighted relates to shape of the eye in humans
			- Vision is a key aspect of communication
				1. Body postures and facial expressions indicate dog feelings and intentions
			- Seeing eye dogs is important for people
			- Freestyle dog courses using vision
			- Hand gestures to train dogs require vision
	- Hearing
		1. Frequency
			- Pitch in Hertz (hz)
			- Humans can hear 65-12000 hz
			- Dogs can hear about 65-47000-60000 hz
			- Dog whistles operate at about 20000-25000 hz
			- Helps predator animal be able to hear things 
			- Vampire bats hear 40000-100000 hz (use echolocation)
				1. Dogs can hear vampire bats
				2. You could teach dogs to scare bats away (ex Mexico and South America to keep bats away from cattle)
		2. Amplitude
			- Volume in Decibel (dB)
				- ---
		3. We can teach dogs to recognize some words but not most. Hearing is not great communication method for dogs.
			- Dogs have limited vocalization so hearing is not as important for communication
	- Olfactory - "smellavision"
		1. Scent enters through sinus passages and specialized nerves pick up smalls and signal to brain
		2. Dogs have much more sensitive sense of smell 
			- 1000-10000 times more sensitive than humans
		3. Brain regulates scent just like vision
			- Brain filters out irrelevant scents so smell sensitivity can be hard to measure
		4. Olfactory bulb = part of brain that we associate with regulating/quantifying scent
			- Dog has about 6 g olfactory bulb while human is 1.5 g
			- 40 x proportion of dog brain dedicated to smell
		5. Turbinate bones = bones located inside the sinus passages
			- Two functions 
				1. Location for olfactory nerves
					- Specialized nerves that pick up scent
				2. More swirly bones moves air around more
					- More surface area is advantageous
					- Increases chance that molecules will bind to olfactory nerve bc of increased air movement
				3. Horses have about one giant swirl
			- Humans = 7 cm long while dogs = 390 cm
				- 5-7 mil receptors in humans
			- Dogs' num of receptors can vary greatly
				1. Not based on size of nose
		6. Ears and Scent?
			- Ears may waft air into nose, but no evidence to support this
		7. Primary Sources of Scent
			- Apocrine Glands
				1. ---
			- Urine 
			- Feces
		8. Uses of Olfactory
			- Humans
				1. Favorable
				2. Unfavorable
				3. Identification
				4. Taste
					- If you lose taste of smell, you lose sense of taste
			- Dogs
				1. Favorable
				2. Unfavorable
				3. Identification
				4. Taste
				5. Age
				6. Sex
				7. Health
				8. Reproductive Status
					- Male can smell estrus in females
			- Use of dogs by humans
				1. Tracking = follows both scent and sight
					- Slow (step by step)
					- Very specific but accurate
				2. Trailing = follows scent only
					- Ex: Bloodhounds and escaped prisoner
					- Wind makes big difference (under 3 mph wind)
						1. May blow scent in different direction
				3. Detection
					- Drug tracking
					- Sniffing out diseases such as cancer
					- Can teach dogs to respond to termites
					- Training can be challenging
						1. Must have scents in containers and train dog to have positive response 
						2. Older dogs are less sensitive
							- May respond to container that used to have something
	- Gustatory Appeal - Taste
		1. Taste bud = sensory nerve
			- If stimulated, active potential goes to brain
			- Number of taste buds
				1. Cows = 25000
				2. Rabbits = 17000
				3. Humans 9000
				4. Dogs = 1700
				5. Cats = 475
				6. Herbivores tend to have higher numbers of taste sensory nerves while carnivores have fewer
					- Omnivores have medium number
			- Fluid binds to taste bud receptors and goes to brain
			- Herbivores eat large variety of foods and need to sort nutrients out whereas carnivores eat only other animals
		2. Types of sensory nerves 
			- Salty = detects minerals we need for nutrients
				1. Humans - Omnivore
					- Low in fruits / veggies 
					- High in meats
				2. Dogs - less developed
					- >80% meat based diet in wild
					- MSG = added to most vegetable based foods
				3. Salty sensors are virtually absent in cats
					- Getting enough sodium from meat
			- Sweet = detects simple carbohydrates
				1. Furaneol
					- Antifreeze poisoning kills 10000-30000 dogs per year bc it tastes sweet
					- Cats don't have sweet taste buds so they are not attracted to furaneol
			- Sour = detects certain vitamins such as vitamin c
				1. Limited studies to see how sour works in dogs
				2. Dogs do have sour taste buds
			- Bitter = most commonly associated w/ toxins that should not be ingested
				1. Dogs and cats are much more sensitive to bitter than humans
				2. Danger detection
					- Dogs and cats more prone to eat materials from scavenging 
				3. Bitter bandage
					- Bitter enough that dogs don't eat bandage
				4. Saccharine
					- Artificial sweetener 
					- Sweet in low doses to us but bitter to cats and dogs even in low doses
			- Umami = detects protein and fats
				1. Animal proteins and fats
				2. MSG = monosodium glutamate
					- Gives savory flavor 
					- Added to dog foods to keep dog nutritionally ok but make people happy
				3. Dogs - Receptors highly tuned vs ours 
					- ---
			- Dogs have all 5 of major types
	- Tactile - Touch
		1. Sensory nerves that tend to monitor surface areas 
		2. Humans have 5 different receptors in fingertips
			 - Warmth, deep pressure, light touch, pain, touch
		3. Dogs have far fewer receptors
			- Primary types
				1. Pressure receptors
					- 40% located in face
					- Vibrissae = whiskers
						1. When it bends, it stimulates nerve
						2. Can sense something without running into it
						3. Blind dogs can do fine as long as they have vibrissae
						4. Horses have whiskers to but sometimes we cut them off for show
					- Neuro-reflex response 
						- Reflex response that makes eyelids close when whiskers are simulated
				2. Temperature
					- Humans - Distinctly separate hot and cold
					- Dogs - Primarily cold
					- Cooling system
						1. We have sweat glands all over
							- Dogs only have sweat glands in paws (not super great at cooling overall)
						2. Neuro-reflex response
							- Dogs can shunt blood to nose them rapid breathing to get rid of heat (panting)
							- Can be stimulated on and off by nerve stimulations as opposed to conscience 
				3. Pain (noci receptors)
					- Neurologically similar
					- Free-ending nerves in skin surface
					- Significant differential response vs humans
						1. Animals show less pain than humans
						2. Showing a weakness is not ideal

1. Deuterostomes = anus forms first and mouth forms second
	1. Radial and indeterminate cleavage
	2. Coelom formed by outpocketing of archenteron
	3. Phylum Echinodermata and Phylum Chordata are under this category
		1. Both have *endoskeletons*
2. Phylum Echinoderm
	1. Endoskeleton is not made of bone but still serves as support
		1. Produces spiny skin feeling
	2. All based on *pentaradial* symmetry
		1. Larvae are bilateral but adults are pentaradial 
	3. Ex: sea urchin, sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, sea lilies
	4. Sea Star Anatomy
		1. Class Asteroidea
		2. Spines around outside
			1. Protection and support
		3. No anterior/posterior surface
			1. Have oral and aboral surface
				1. Aboral is on top
				2. Oral is on bottom (along w/ mouth)
		4. Tube feet
			1. Locomotion, grasping objects, adhesion, etc.
			2. On oral surface
		5. 5 arms
			1. Identical internal organs/structures
		6. Middle
			1. Called the central disk
			2. Round structure between two arms
				1. *Madreporite* = allows water to enter 
					1. Apart of the water vascular system
					2. Located on aboral surface
		7. Dissection
			1. Remove tips of three arms 
			2. Make incision on either side of the arms
			3. Lift skin and remove top dermal surface from central disk and the arms
			4. *Pyloric ceca* = function like liver
				1. Used for digestion
				2. Lighter material closest to aboral surface
			5. Gonad structures darker than the pyloric ceca
				1. Underneath the pyloric ceca
			6. *Ambulacral ridge* down middle of arm
				1. Jelly-like structures called *ampullae* around it
				2. Involved in the water vascular system
					1. Hydraulic system to move body parts
				3. Water -> Madreporite -> Series of canals (rain canal to radial canal) -> Water fills ampullae (when squeezed, pushed water to tube feet to extend or retract)
			7. *Dermal ossicles*
				1. Skin bones 
				2. Connected to spines
				3. Part of skeletal system
			8. Spongy mass in central area = stomach
				1. Two stomachs
					1. Two-chambered structure
				2. Stomach can be turned inside out to feed
					1. Pushed out the mouth to begin digestion
					2. Then pulls back inside to complete digestion
				3. Complete digestive system
				4. Small pore for anus

		> Echinoderms are slow animals radically different from us, but they are an evolutionary success. All echinoderms have ==five-part symmetry (pentaradial)==. We see the inner workings of sea stars, from their ==tube feet== to their ==skeleton==.
		> 
		> ==Urchins== are ferocious herbivores chomping down kelp with their jaws. ==Cucumbers== vacuum clean food from the sediment with their tube feet having a big affect on sea floor ecology. ==Brittle stars== blanket some areas of the ocean bottom catching drifting plankton.
		> 
		> Echinoderms ==pump water into their tube feet, giving them power to move==. They have ==light-sensing organs== and can ==smell their way to food==. Sea stars are formidable predators. We see their tube feet pry open a mussel and ==extrude the stomach== into the mussel. A camera inside the mussel shows us actual footage of the stomach digesting the mussel. We also see the formidable many armed sun star chase and catch a snail.

3. Phylum Chordata
	1. Defining characteristics of chordates (NDPP)
		1. *Notochord*
		2. *Dorsal hollow nerve chord*
		3. *Pharyngeal slits*
			1. Holes in anterior portion of digestive track
		4. *Post-anal tail* 
		5. May loose these features in adulthood
	2. Protochordates
		1. Two Invertebrate Subphyla
		2. Subphylum Urochordata
			1. The *tunicates*
				1. AKA sea squirts
			2. Adults are sessile 
				1. Lose notochord, post-anal tail, and dorsal hollow nerve chord
			3. Filter feeders
				1. Permanently attached to a substrate 
			4. Water flows in through the incurrent siphon (using cilia) into the pharynx and out the excurrent siphon
		3. Subphylum Cephalochordata
			1. The *lancelets* 
			2. Has two pointed ends
			3. Anterior-most structure is the *rostrum*
			4. *Buccal cirri* tentacles by mouth
			5. *Dorsal fin* and *caudal fins*
				1. No paired fins
			6. *Myomeres* = segmented muscles
			7. Filter feeders
			8. *Dorsal hollow nerve chord* w/ *eyespot* near the front
				1. No eyes (simple eyespots for light detection)
			9. *Notochord* = semiflexible rod that stiffens body
				1. Resistance to effects of muscular contraction, making coordinated movement possible
			10. DS
				1. Buccal Cavity (mouth)
					1. Depends on cilia to draw food in
					1. Seen on *wheel organ* in buccal cavity
					2. Uses mucus to trap food
				2. Velum
				3. Pharynx
					1. Gill bars and gill slits
					2. Water chamber called atrium surrounds the pharynx
					3. Water passing from the pharynx moves posteriorly through the atrium and exits through the atriopore
				4. Esophagus
				5. Stomach
					1. Hepatic caecum secretes enzymes and takes part in nutrient absorption (like liver)
					2. Gonads near the stomach (either ovaries or testis)
				6. Intestines
				7. Anus

			      ![[Pasted image 20230313172021.png]]
				1. Cross-section runs approximately right through the hepatic caecum

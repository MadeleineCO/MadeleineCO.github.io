1. Malaria and Sickle Cell Anemia
	1. SCA causes crescents instead of disks
	2. Didn't disappear in the gene pool through natural selection
		1. Very prevalent, especially in Africa
	3. Reducing oxygen reveals sickle cells if you are a carrier
		1. In high oxygen environments, normal cells
	4. Places w/ high incidence of malaria had high incidence of SCA
		1. Carriers are protected against malaria (heterozygous)
		2. Selection against both AA and SS in malaria environments
	5. Caused by a single nucleotide change in hemoglobin protein part of DNA
2. Hereditary blood disorders that affects RBCs
	1. RBCs are meant to carry oxygen
		1. Need oxygen to create ATP
	2. Normally round and concaved
		1. Maximizes oxygen carrying potential
		2. Hemoglobin = protein for RBCs
	3. In SCA, hemoglobin is incorrect
		1. Only takes one wrong nucleotide
			1. Single-point mutation
		2. Doesn't carry enough oxygen and can get clogged more easily
	4. HbA = Normal hemoglobin allele
		1. HbS = Sickle hemoglobin allele
		2. Must be SS to have sickle cell anemia (HbS/HbS)
		3. HbA/HbS or HbA/HbA do not express sickle cell anemia
3. Chromosomes
	1. Allele = a variation of a gene
		1. A or a
		2. Different possibilities you could have for a gene
		3. One from mother and one from father
	3. Locus = a spot on a chromosome
		1. Location of a gene
	4. Homozygous genotype = AA or aa
	5. Heterozygous genotype = Aa
4. Malaria is caused by a parasite that lives in the blood of mosquitos 
	1. Mosquito = vector
	2. A copy of HbS can make someone resistant to malaria
		1. If you are homo rec, you have sickle cell anemia (more likely to die)
		2. If you are homo dom, you don't have SCA but you aren't resistant to malaria
		3. Hetero is most beneficial in areas w/ mosquitos 
			1. Heterozygotic advantage
5. Statistics 
	1. Allelic frequencies = percentage of HbA and HbS
		1. p + q = 1
		2. Ex: in an area with malaria, most people are HbA/HbS (about 0.50 + 0.50 = 1)
	2. Genotypic frequencies = percentage of HbA/HbA, HbA/HbS, HbS/HbS
		1. p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1

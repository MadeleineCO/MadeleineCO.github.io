1. Movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration across [[Plasma Membranes]]
	1. This form of transportation does not require energy
	2. Diffusion down the concentration gradient
		- Diffusion is movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentration
		- Will continue until concentration is same in all regions
2. Major barrier to crossing membrane is the hydrophobic interior that repels polar molecules but not nonpolar molecules
	1. Nonpolar molecules move until concentration is equal on both sides
	2. Limited permeability to small polar molecules
		- Very limited permeability to larger polar molecules and ions
	3. How does cell get things like glucose (big and polar) inside? How does cell get things outside of cell?
		- Not an absolute barrier. It is semi-permeable. 
			- [[Water]] (polar) can get through barrier bc it is so small
				1. Same w/ gases like CO2
				2. Alcohol and ethical can get through (although not as easily bc larger)
				3. Glucose is too big
			- Charged molecules generally cannot diffuse
		- Facilitated diffusion
			- Moves substances down concentration gradient. 
			- May cross membrane w/ aid of channel [[Protein|proteins]]
				1. Allow diffusion like gates
				2. Hydrophilic channel when open
			- Carrier [[Protein|proteins]]
				1. Bind specifically to molecules they assist
				2. Capable of grabbing specific [[Cell|cells]]
3. Ion channels
	1. Allow the passage of ions
	2. Gated channels (open or close in response to chemical or electrical stimulus)
		- Charges can open or close them
		- How neurons work
	3. 3 conditions to determine direction
		- Relative concentration on either side of membrane
		- Voltage differences across membrane
	4. When open, high to low concentration diffusion
4. [[Osmosis]]

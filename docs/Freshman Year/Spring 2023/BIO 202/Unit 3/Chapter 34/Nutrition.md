		2. Antibodies/Hormones
		3. Structural (hair/skin)
		4. Transport (hemoglobin)
	2. 20 essential AAs
		1. Eight must come from diet
			1. Regular supply is needed to make other AAs
	3. Catabolism products
		1. NH3 (ammonia) -> CO2 -> Urea (less toxic form of nitrogenous waste)
3. Lipids or Fats
	1. Major uses
		1. Energy reserves
		2. Insulation
		3. Hormones
		4. Cell membranes
	2. Essential fatty acids

			2. Helps liver remove LDL
4. Digestive Enzymes 
	1. Polysaccharide digestion
		1. Salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase
		2. Starch + H2O -> Maltose
	2. Disaccharide digestion
		1. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose
		2. Lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose
			1. See lactose intolerant diagram
			2. We are all slightly intolerant (only so much milk we can handle) 
	3. Protein digestion
		1. Pepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides (smaller peptide chains)
			1. Trypsin also does this
		2. Peptidases take polypeptides and break them down into AAs (monomers)
			1. A peptidase for every AA you need to obtain
	4. Triglyceride digestion
		1. Bile salts emulsify the fats 
		2. Then lipase breaks down the fats into glycerol and two fatty acids
5. Nucleic acids are broken down by nucleases and nucleosidases
6. Digestive Enzyme Review

	5. Nucleic acids (nucleases and nucleosidases)
7. Absorption of Nutrients

	3. B-vitamins (1, 2, 6, 12)
		1. Coenzymes (Cellular respiration, Nucleic acid synthesis)
			1. Necessary to attach to active site that allows other enzyme to attach
		2. Hormones/hemoglobin
			1. B12 deficiency can cause anemia
		3. Water soluble
	4. Vitamin K
		1. Blood clotting
		2. Fat soluble
	5. Mostly found in fruits and veggies
	6. Excess fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in your body, whereas water-soluble vitamins cannot be stored
	7. Scurvy

	11. Sodium (Na+)
		1. Nerve conduction and H2O/Cl- regulation
	12. Electrolytes 
		1. ---
		2. Gatorade, Pedialyte 
9. Human nutrition
	1. About 2000 kCal (males need more than females)

[[2022-10-22]]
In the 1900's, basis for ideas about heredity stated that ---::heredity occurs within species and traits are transmitted directly from both parents to offspring; Led to false belief that inheritance is *blending* of parental traits
^1666546506446

Early botanists produced ---::hybrids (crosses between two true-breeding parents)
^1666546506458

When hybrids were crossed, some offspring resembled the original true-bred strains rather than ---::hybrid parents (the hybrids were not true-breeding); Contradicted idea that inherited traits are always a blending of parental traits
^1666546506465

Mendel (1800's) studied pea plants because ---::hybrids could be produced, many "varieties" were available, they are small/easy to grow, and they can self-fertilize or be cross-fertilized
^1666546506473

A plant has both male and female ---::gamete producing tissues; A plant that self-fertilizes creates a true-breeder
^1666546506479

Mendel's methods #1::Produce true-breeding strains for many traits (ex green color, wrinkled peas, etc.)
^1666546506486

Mendel's methods #2::Cross true-breeding strains having alternate forms of a trait to produce hybrids; Cross-pollination
^1666546506493

Mendel's methods #3::Preform reciprocal crosses (each plant serves alternatively as a "mother" and a "father")
^1666546506501

Mendel's methods #4::Allow the hybrids to self-fertilize and count the num of offspring showing each form of the trait
^1666546506508

Mendel produced true-breeding pea strains for 7 different traits, each trait with 2 alternate forms (variations). He then produced ---::hybrids by pollination.
^1666546506515

Monohybrid cross::Studies 2 forms of a single trait; Hybridized the 2 true-breeding strains for each trait; Ex: violet flowers + white --> F1 hybrid w/ violet --> F2 from self-fertilization (3:1 violet to white)
^1666546506522

F1 generation (1st filial generation)::“hybrid” offspring produced by crossing 2 true-breeding strains; For every trait, all F1 plants resembled only 1 parent (other form of the trait “disappeared”); No plants with characteristics intermediate between the 2 parents were produced (no blending)
^1666546506531

Dominant::The form of each trait seen in the F1 plants (ex violet flower color)
^1666546506538

Recessive::The form of the trait that "disappeared" in the F1 plants (ex white flower color)
^1666546506545

F2 generation::Offspring resulting from the self-fertilization of F1 plants (F1 x F1 = F2)
^1666546506552

F2 plants exhibited both forms of ---::the trait; ¾ (75%) of the plants had the dominant form; ¼ (25%) of the plants had the recessive form; The dominant:recessive ratio was 3:1.
^1666546506560

By producing F3 plants, Mendel discovered the ratio is actually ---::1:2:1; (25%) true-breeding dominant plants; (50%) not-true-breeding dominant plants; (25%) true-breeding recessive plants
^1666546506566

 Mendel's generational results sum::Parent generation (two true-breeding strains) --> F1 (100% dominant but not true-breeding) --> F2 (3:1 ratio) --> F3 (1:2:1)
^1666546506573

Gene (bio2)::Section of a chromosome that codes for a particular trait (or for one polypeptide chain; protein or quaternary protein interactions)
^1666546539876

Alleles::Alternate forms genes that occur on homologous chromosomes: Dominant or Recessive versions; One comes from father and one from mother
^1666546506583

Homozygous::Having all of the same allele (ex AA, aa)
^1666546506590

Heterozygous::Having different alleles (ex Aa)
^1666546506597

Genotype::The alleles carried by an individual; RR = homozygous dominant (can produce only R gametes); Rr = heterozygous (can produce both R and r gametes); rr = homozygous recessive (can produce only r gametes)
^1666546506605

Phenotype::Outward appearance: The result of many different genes, interactions among those genes, and environmental effects.
^1666546506611

Principle of Segregation::Alleles separate (segregate) during gamete formation; If homozygous, all gametes have same forms; If heterozygous, half gametes have dominant allele and half have recessive
^1666546506620

Alleles are joined at random during ---::fertilization to produce genotype of offspring; One allele from father and one from mother; Creates genetic diversity through different alleles combinations (genotypes)
^1666546506628

Punnett Squares::Can be used to predict offspring genotypes; Determine genotypes of gametes produced by each parent; 2 x 2 square is used for monohybrid crosses
^1666830480852

In monohybrid crosses, you look at ---::one gene; Most traits and phenotypes are more complicated than just two alleles; F1 = 3:1 ratio, F2 = 1:2:1 ratio
^1666830480857

In monohybrid crosses, parents are ---::homo dom and homo rec then F1 are hetero then F2 are 25% homo dom, 50% hetero, 25% homo
^1666830480861

Pedigree analysis is used to ---::track inheritance patterns in families
^1666830480865

Both parents must be at least --- for recessive gene to show in offspring::hetero; Rec gene often skips generations whereas dom gene shows up in every generation; Carriers of gene are hetero
^1666830480869

Dihybrid crosses::Examines 2 separate traits in a single cross (ex RRYY x rryy); Gametes of this parent 1 are all RY and gametes of this parent 2 are all ry so F1 is all RrYy (dom phenotype)
^1666830480873

Crossing dihybrid heteros results in 9:3:3:1 ratio (ex RrYy w/ RrYy); 9 dom, dom (RY):3 rec, dom (rY), 3 dom, rec (Ry), 1 rec, rec (ry)

Principle of independent assortment::Alleles assort independently (ex YyRr can produce all combos gamete genotypes); Only happens if alleles are on different chromosomes or far apart
^1666830480877

If alleles are close together on same chromosome, they are said to be ---::linked and therefore do not follow principle of independent assortment; Do not get normal phenotypic ratio
^1666830480881

Test crosses::Used to determine the genotype of an individual w/ dom phenotype (is it homo dom or hetero?); Cross unknown individual w/ homo rec so the offspring phenotypic ratios differ depending on unknown parent (if homo dom, offspring must all have dom phenotype but if hetero, offspring may show rec phenotype)
^1666830480885

Extensions to Mendel::Mendel's model of inheritance assumes that each trait controlled by a single gene; Each gene only has 2 alleles; Clear dom-rec relationship between alleles; Most genes *do not* meet these criteria
^1666830480888

Polygenic inheritance: multiple genes control phenotype; These traits show continuous variation and are referred to as quantitative traits (not discrete); Ex: height, hair color, skin color

Pleiotrophy::One allele has more than one effect on the phenotype; Ex: cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia (multiple symptoms can be traced back to one defective allele); Discrete and qualitative
^1666830480892

Incomplete dominance (blending inheritance)::The heterozygote is intermediate in phenotype between the 2 homozygotes; Ex: homo dom is red and homo rec is white, hetero is pink
^1666830480896

Codominance::The heterozygote shows some aspect of both homozygous phenotypes; Ex: the ABO blood group system shows multiple alleles (3 possible alleles of the I gene (IA, IB, and i); individuals only have two of these) and codominance (IA and IB are dominant to i but codominant to each other); the I gene codes for glycoproteins on blood cells
^1666830480900

Blood types (A, B, O, AB) have multiple alleles that determine some traits (more than two possible genes at same locus). Different combos result in ---::different sugars exhibited, different surface antibodies produced
^1666830480904

A blood can't mix w/ B bc of ---::surface antibodies that would cause them to bind and coagulate; O has no surface antibodies so it is a universal donor
^1666830480908

[[2022-10-28]]
RH factor genes can be --- or ---::positive (dom); negative (rec)
^1666996171576

 If pregnant woman has O- blood and father is O+ then the child is ---::O+ blood; Blood that is passing through placenta removes CO2, and the point where mother's blood and child's blood mixes, immune responses develop; First child may be ok, but mother's antibodies will build and react to a second child
^1666996171585

Multiple alleles determine ---::some traits; More than two possible genes at the same locus (specific street address for a gene on a chromosome); Multiple alleles can all affect same trait; Ex: human blood types and fur color
^1666996171594

An individual heterozygous for four genes, having a genotype of AaBbCcDd. Genes B and C are linked. Genes A and D assort independently (they can cross over during meiosis). The possible gametes would be ---::ABCD, ABCd, aBCD, aBCd (B linked with C) and AbcD, Abcd, abcD, and abcd (b linked with c); The individual would not produce alleles with Bc or bC combinations.
^1666996171602

Sex-linked traits::When genes are found only on sex chromosomes
^1666996171608

Thomas Morgan looked at fruit flies (4 large chromosomes) and noticed that red eyes were dom but some white eyed flies. Did not follow normal 3:1 phenotypical ration bc white eyed flies were usually ---::male; The gene for eye color located on sex chromosome
^1666996171614

Females are homo (XX) while males are hetero (XY); If you have only one copy of a gene (as most often seen in males), it is ---::expressed
^1666996171621

Colorblindness most commonly found in --- bc colorblindness is carried on the --- chromosome::men; X
^1666996171627

Female carriers can pass on either colorblind copy or unaffected copy. If female passes on coloblind gene, males will have it and daughters will be carriers. If female passes on good gene, ---::no one is affected (assuming father is normal)
^1666996171633

Epistasis::The products of different genes interact to influence the phenotype (one gene can interfere with the expression of another gene).
^1666996171639

If pigment production only occurs when a dominant C allele is present and AA or Aa produces brown color, whereas aa produces black, then mice w/ recessive c will be ---::white; This is example of epistasis bc even if mice have AA or Aa for brown, they cannot have any pigment without dom C
^1666996171647

Expression of some genes can be influenced by the ---::environment; Ex: coat color in rabbits and Siamese cats (allele produces enzyme that allows pigment production only at temps below 33* C)
^1666996171654

All --- must respond to the environment::cells; Ex: sunburn or tan depending on alleles in response to sun
^1666996171661

Rule of addition::The probability of an event that can occur in two or more independent ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of the different ways.
^1666996171667

When crossing Pp x Pp, the probability of producing Pp offspring is ---::probability of obtaining Pp (1/4) PLUSprobability of obtaining pP (1/4); ¼  +  ¼  =  ½
^1666996171673

Rule of multiplication::the probability that independent events will occur simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.
^1666996171680

When crossing RrYy  x  RrYy, the probability of obtaining rryy offspring is ---::probability of obtaining rr  = ¼ TIMES probability of obtaining yy = ¼; probability of rryy = ¼  x  ¼  =  1/16
^1666996171687

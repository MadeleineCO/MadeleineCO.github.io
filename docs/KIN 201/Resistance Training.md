1. Must be tailored to an individual's goals in a safe and effective way
2. Basic principles of resistance training
	- Principle of overload
		1. Body has to be stressed passed a certain threshold in order to adapt
		2. Must challenge you in some way in order to provide benefits
		3. Overload w/ weights can come from repetition or high weight
	- Principle of specificity
		1. Adapt specifically to what you do
	- Principle of variation
		1. Must provide variety so you don't plateau
		2. Often called periodization
			- Heavy day, moderate day, light day
			- Planned variation
3. Health benefits
	- Increasing lean muscle mass
		1. Affects daily metabolic rate, which effects body fat
	- Improves bone health
		1. Prevents ostio perosis 
		2. Peak bone mass in young adulthood
	- Improved quality of life
	- For a muscle to adapt, it must be trained at least 2 days per week
	- ACSM recommendation
		1. Resistance training 2-3 days per week
		2. About 20 min per session
3. Goals
	- Strength
		1. Highest amount of force that you can produce
		2. How much weight can you possible lift?
		3. May be slow lifts (unlike power)
		4. Train w/ heavy weights but few repetitions
		5. Allow lots of rest
		6. 6 repetitions or fewer w/ longer rest of 3 min
	- Power
		1. The amount of force you can produce over time
		2. More explosive than strength
	- Hypertrophy
		1. Building muscle mass
		2. How big can you make muscles?
		3. Different from strength but some overlap
		4. In the middle of local muscular endurance and strength 
		5. Moderate resistance, moderate rest period, moderate num of repetitions 
	- Local muscular endurance
		1. Ex: pushup endurance
		2. Relatively force over lots of repetitions 
		3. More fatigue resistance
		4. 15 or more repetitions w/ a min or less of rest
		5. Lower resistance, high velocity exercises before strength training
		6. Lots of rest between sets
	- Can only max one of these four goals at a time
		1. Some overlap, but can only completely target  one to maximize 
	- If you are new, well-structured training programs start at local muscular endurance then gradually progress across hypertrophy over to strength and power
4. Exercise selection and technique
	- Number one goal is safety
		1. Extra forces directed in an improper way can do significant damage
	- When seated or laying down, skeletal/injury risk is generally lower
		1. Should maintain 5 points of contact
			- Head, Between shoulder blades, butt, right foot, and left foot
	- When standing, easier to have bad technique
		1. Weight should be evenly distributed across each foot
			- Don't put weight on ball of foot or rock forwards
		2. Maintain neutral spine position ("flat back") throughout movement
			- Don't hunch or arch spine
			- Can move torso independently of back (flex and extend at hip and knee points to maintain straight back)
5. Exercise selection
	- Principle of specificity
	- Principle of variation
	- Think about what you are trying to improve at
	- Health benefits vs performance benefits 
	- Can choose general exercises that help overall
	- Upper body
		1. Push
		2. Vertical pull
		3. Row
	- Lower body
		1. Squat/lunge
		2. Hip hinge
	- Core
		1. More than just abs
			- Crunches help abs
		2. Ring of muscles around core as well
	- Multi-joint movements are often more time-efficient
	- Single-joint movements can help target specific weaknesses

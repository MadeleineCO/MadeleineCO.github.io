1. Hydrostatic
	1. Soft-bodied invertebrates
		1. Terrestrial animals such as earthworms and slugs
		2. Aquatic animals such as jellyfish and squid
	2. Uses a fluid-filled cavity
	3. Advantage = flexible
	4. Disadvantages
		5. Can become too dry
		6. Very squishy
2. Exoskeleton 
	1. Rigid hard case
	2. Seen in Arthropods (chitin)
		1. Muscles attach internally
	3. Advantages
		1. Resist desiccation
			1. Impermeable
		2. Protection
	4. Disadvantages 
		1. Must molt to grow
		2. Weighs more
			1. Limits size of arthropods (must be relatively small)
		3. Right after molting, vulnerable to predation 
			1. Takes time to fully harden
3. Endoskeleton
	1. First seen in Echinoderms (made of CaCO3 - calcium carbonate)
	2. Vertebrates (made of Ca3(PO4)2 - calcium phosphate called hydroxyapatite)
		1. Collagen + hydroxyapatite
	3. Cartilage (joint movement)
	4. Ligaments (joint stability)
	5. Tendons (muscle attachment)
	6. Functions
		1. Protection 
			1. Organs such as lungs and heart
		2. Muscle attachment
			1. Support & Movement
		3. Living tissue
			1. Produces white/red blood cells
				1. Densely packed w/ marrow
				2. WBCs mature in bone marrow before joining immune system
			2. Can remodel from stress
				1. Broken bones can heal
				2. Tension, compression, torsion, etc.
		4. Mineral storage
			1. Calcium and phosphate storage
				1. Phosphorus needed for ATP and nucleotides
			2. Osteoclasts can release minerals by breaking down bone if needed
4. Human Axial Skeleton
	1. Bones of central axis
		1. Skull (w/ cranial bones)
			1. Mandible = low-jaw
			2. Maxilla (up-jaw)
			3. Babies have soft spot on skull for flexibility during labor (hardens and fully forms later)
		2. Sternum
			1. Must cut through sternum to perform open heart surgery 
		3. Rib cage
		4. Vertebral column
			1. 33 vertebra total
			2. Cervical (7)
				1. Atlas ("yes")
					1. Only requires atlas to perform "yes"
				2. Axis ("no")
					1. Requires both atlas and axis articulation to perform "no" gesture
				3. Major change for vertebrate evolution
					1. Head movement independence 
			3. Thoracic (12)
			4. Lumbar (5)
			5. Sacral (5 fused)
			6. Coccyx (4 fused)
				1. Tiny
				2. Tail bone
			7. Intervertebral disc lie in-between vertebra 
			8. See graphic
5. Human Appendicular Skeleton
	1. Bones of the limbs
		1. Pectoral girdle (forelimbs)
			1. Scapula
			2. Clavicle
				1. Collar bone
			3. Humerus
			4. Radius & Ulna
			5. Carpals & Metacarpals
				1. Forms the wrist
			6. Phalanges
			7. See graphic 
		2. Pelvic girdle (hindlimbs)
			1. Ilium 
			2. Ischium
			3. Pubis
			4. See graphic
		3. Hindlimbs
			1. Femur
			2. Patella
			3. Tibia & Fibula
				1. Tibia is larger 
					1. Shin bone
				2. Fibula is calf bone
			4. Tarsals & Metatarsals 
				1. Forms the ankle
			5. Phalanges

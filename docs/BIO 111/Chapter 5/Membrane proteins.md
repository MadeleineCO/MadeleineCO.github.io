1. [[Plasma Membranes]] and Functions
	1. Transporters
		- [[Protein|proteins]] can create channels for hydrophobic molecules
	2. Enzymes
		- Can work to speed up reaction (catalyst)
		- Cell surface receptors
			- Communication
	3. [[Cell]] surface identity makers
		- Mark as like or foreign
	4. [[Cell]] to cell adhesion [[protein|proteins]]
		- Junction
		- Attachments to the cytoskeleton
2. Integral membrane [[protein|proteins]]
	1. Span the [[lipid]] bilayer (transmembrane [[protein|proteins]])
		- Nonpolar regions are embedded in interior of bilayer
		- Polar regions protrude from both sides of bilayer
		- Single pass transmembrane [[protein]]
			- Can go through once
			- Front = N terminal (outside)
			- Back = c terminal (inside of [[cell]])
		- Triple pass [[protein|proteins]]
			- Can go through three times
		- Beta sheet [[protein]]
			- N terminal and c terminal on same side
		- Transmembrane, Membrane associated, Lipid linked, and protein attached
		- [[Protein]] attached
			- Quaternary structure
			- [[Protein]] to protein interaction
	2. HIV binds to CD4 receptor (surface marker), a glycoprotein on the surfaces of T [[cell|cells]]
		1. Brought in by endocytosis
			- 7 pass transmembrane protein are groups of proteins that are one of most abundant transmembrane proteins found in [[cell|cells]]
			- Activated by virus
			- Forms vesicle with virus inside
			- Fuses with lysosome (digestion organelle) that releases virus to rest of [[cell]]
				- Also how cholesterol gets inside [[cell]]

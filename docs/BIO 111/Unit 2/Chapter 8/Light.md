1. [[Photosynthesis]]
	- Can act as a wave w/ crests and troughs 
	- The distance between a crest and a crest or a trough and a trough is called wavelength
	- Different wavelengths have different characteristics
		1. Electromagnetic spectrum
			- Visible light is a very small part of the spectrum
				1. Very precise wavelengths (400-700 nanometers is visible light)
					- Violet is 400 nanometers
						1. Highest energy
					- Red is 700 nanometers
						1. Lowest energy
		1. Shorter wavelengths have more energy and longer wavelengths have less energy (inverse relationship)
			1. Gamma rays are very small and are radioactive
			2. Radio waves are long and very low energy and span great distances

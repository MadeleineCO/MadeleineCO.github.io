I. [[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]]
	A. Multi-chambered stomach
		- [[Herbivores]]
		- Cows ([[Cattle (Bovine)]]) have one stomach with four different chambers
	B. [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]]
II. Digestive process
	A. Begins with mastication
		- Mouth: mechanical digestion 
	B. Esophagus
		- "Two way system"
			a. Can swallow both directions easily
			b. Swallows food, goes to first part of stomach, then reforms bolus and sends it back up for additional mastication
				i. Chewing cud
					~ Chew circularly
				ii. Important for animals like deer because they can grab a bunch of potential nutrients before hiding in woods to truly masticate
			c. Recycles nutrients
		- Transport of ingested material from mouth to stomach
	C. Stomach: multichambered (most have 4 chambers)
		- Forestomach
		- Rumen/Reticulum
			a. Not very distinct units but different functions
			b. Reticulum (2nd)
				i. Often called honeycomb
				ii. Bolus formation (to create a bolus of ingested material to swallow back to mouth for more mastication/mechanical digestion)
				iii. Acts as a trap where it collects indigestible materials
					~ Stays there throughout animal's life
					~ Hardware disease: Eating stuff cattle shouldn't, including things like wire
						~ Can poke through reticulum and irritate heart area
						~ Can feed cows magnets to bind stuff together
			c. Rumen (1st)
				i. Largest chamber of digestive system
					~ Can be 50-80 gallons
				ii. Microbial digestion (Fermentation)
					~ Letting microorganisms digest stuff and make by-products
					~ Symbiotic relationship: benefits both organisms
						~ Bacteria, fungi, yeast, protozoa
						~ Dark, warm, plenty of food for microbials
						~ The by-products benefit the animal (gain nutrients from by-products and also digest microbes for nutrients)
					~ Energy - [[ANS Carbohydrates]]
					~ Microbial Contribution
						~ Energy - VFA
						~ Protein - Amino acids
						~ Vitamins - B complex
							~ [[Omnivores]] and [[Carnivores]] cannot produce b complex vitamins (now we get them from animals that can concentrate b complex vitamins in meat)
		- Omasum (3rd)
			i. Acts as a separator (strainer) between rumen and the rest of the GI track
				~ Sorts material
				~ Big stuff in rumen for microbial digestion and smaller stuff goes to abomasum
		- Abomasum (4th)
			i. The gastric stomach
			ii. Chemical digestion
				~ Acids, enzymes
			iii. Then goes to small intestines
	D. Small intestines
		a. Proximal - beginning of small intestine
			i. Some digestion
			ii. Some absorption of nutrients
		b. Distal - end of small intestines
			i. Predominantly absorption
		c. Then goes to cecum
	E. Cecum
		a. Have a large cecum	
		b. More microbial digestion
		c. Fermentation so mostly volatile fatty acids and b complex vitamins
		d. Then goes to large intestine
	F. Large intestine
		a. Water metabolism

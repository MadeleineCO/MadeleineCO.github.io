1. [[Historical Perspective of Evolution]]
2. Natural Selection
	1. Darwinian reflections after trip
		1. Species are not fixed
		2. Must change through time
	2. On *The Origin of Species*
		1. Wallace sent his paper in 1858
		2. Lyell encouraged publication
		3. Darwin 1859
		4. Natural selection
	3. Basis of natural selection
		1. Organisms exhibit heritable variation
		2. Organisms compete for resources
			1. Some may be outcompeted
			2. Effect of population density and resource competition
		3. Individuals vary w/ repro success
		4. Organisms may adapt w/ environmental changes
			1. Individual organisms do not change more than it is able w/ it's set of genes, but across a population, changes may occur
	4. Mechanism for modification
		1. Variation through genes
		2. Selective pressure at individual level
			1. Does affect individuals as some will live while others may not
	5. Heritable traits
		1. Unit of heredity = gene
			1. Allele = variation of a gene
		2. Passed to offspring
		3. May be selected for or against
			1. Darwin's finches came from common ancestor in SA 
			2. Can see "dead ends" in fossils
			3. Genetics are present in the population
				1. Never adding like LaMarck thought
		4. Competition
			1. Limited resources available
			2. Pop increases while resources decrease
			3. Individuals will die
		5. Fitness
			1. Repro success relative to others
			2. Ability to spread genes
			3. More fit --> spread more genes
			4. Males are often more brightly colored for sexual selection
				1. Purpose is to spread genes to the next generation
		6. Adaption 
			1. Evolved trait --> better suited to env.
			2. Result of natural selection
3. Fossil Evidence
	1. Fossils = Remains or traces of past life
		1. The process is rare but chances increase w/ time
		2. Fossilization requires specific conditions
			1. A whole organism
				1. Often following floods or volcanic events
			2. Fossilization switches living tissue for minerals 
				1. Ex: bones
	2. Transitional species
		1. Traits between species can be seen in fossil record
		2. Links the species together
		3. Common ancestor
			1. Ensures that there is a common ancestor
		4. The "missing" link
			1. Fills in gap between common ancestor and present-day species
		5. Ex: transition to fish to tetrapod amphibian
			1. Tetrapod evolution
				1. Linked fish --> amphibians
				2. *Euthenopteron* (fish)
				3. *Panderichthys* (fish)
				4. *Tiktaalik* (transitional)
				5. *Acanthostega* (amphibian)
				6. *Ichthyostega* (amphibian)
		6. Whale & Elephant evolution
			1. Whale
				1. Modern whales have remnants of four-limbed partially aquatic mammals features
				2. Mammoths and more to fill in gaps 
4. Anatomical Evidence
	1. Homologous structures
		1. Anatomically similar structures that were inherited from common ancestor
		3. Ex: Vertebrate forelimbs
			1. Phalanges
		4. Ex: Vertebrate development
			1. Tail as embryos
	2. Analogous structures
		1. Anatomically similar structures that originated independently
		2. Multiple times
		3. Ex: Animal flight
			1. Birds, Pterosaurs, and Bats
		4. Ex: Shape of aquatic animals
			1. Dolphins vs fish
	3. Vestigial structures
		1. Remnants from a previous ancestors that remain in derived species
			1. Important for ancestor but no longer important for derived species
		3. Ex: pelvic girdle in snakes/whales
			1. Snakes from lizards
5. Biochemical Evidence
	1. All living organisms have DNA
		1. Main holder of genetic info
		2. DNA --> RNA --> Protein
		3. Unifying factor of all life
	2. Cytochrome-c protein
		1. Cytochrome is used for the ETC
		2. Similar AA in eukaryotes
		3. Monkey (1AA) difference from humans
		4. Monkey (11AA) difference from ducks
		5. Monkey (51AA) difference from yeast
		6. Still cytochrome functionally
	3. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
		1. *Staphylococcus aureus*
			1. Common in skin flora of 1/3 of people
			2. Already had genes for resistance
			3. Expressed Penicillin resistance by 1945
			4. Expressed Methicillin resistance by 1961
		2. Changes observable in years
		3. Selects for bacteria that are most likely to resist antibiotic
			1. Some can consume antibiotics
6. Biogeographical Evidence
	1. Similarities in global strata
		1. Same chemical composition
		2. All continents were connected
			1. Pangea
		3. Changed through time through plate tectonics
	2. Marsupials in Australia
		1. SA + Antarctica + Australia
		2. Egg-laying --> pouch --> placenta
		3. Marsupials only in SA/Australia
		4. Placental mammals "better"
			1. End up dominating in other regions
			2. Migrated to SA (Isthmus of Panama)
				1. Outcompeted marsupials
		5. Australia has been isolated longer so marsupials weren't outcompeted
7. Misconceptions of Evolution
	1. Evolution is just a theory
		1. Theories must be repeatedly tested and supported --> principle of biology
			1. Does not mean its infallible or cannot change
		2. Alternative theories are not testable --> not scientific
	2. Individuals in a population evolve
		1. Evolution results from changes in genetic composition over generations
			1. Occurs at a populational level
		2. Individual change is growth/development
			1. Average trait changes
	3. Evolution is a theory tied to origin of life
		1. Derived to explain how life changed once it was here
			1. Does not directly relate to origin of life questions
		2. Drugs select for resistant strains already in population
			1. Genetics are already in the population
	4. Transitional fossils remain unknown
		1. Well-known to scientists because fossilization is rare
			1. Most fossils that would fill in gaps will likely remain unknown
	5. Organisms evolve on purpose
		1. Individuals do *not* evolve, but a population over generations might
		2. The adaptive trait already exists in a population
			1. Natural selection then acts
	6. Random chance alone guides evolution
		1. Chance is only a part of evolution of complex traits over time
		2. Mutations occur randomly but selection does not occur randomly
	7. Evolution is not testable
		1. By definition, it has been tested/retested 100s of times
		2. Genetics and DNA technology has provided robust evidence
	8. Humans evolved directly from apes
		1. Humans (*Homo sapiens*) share an ancestor w/ modern apes
		2. Ancestor is different from modern humans *and* monkeys
8. [[Species Concept]]

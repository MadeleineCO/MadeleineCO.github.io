13. Digestive Organs Review
	1. See graph on slideshow
	2. Mechanical -> Chemical -> Absorption -> Elimination
	3. Bolus (mouth -> pharynx -> esophagus -> stomach)
	4. Chyme (food + gastric juice from stomach -> small intestine)
	5. Digestion (mouth + stomach + duodenum)
	6. Absorption (sto + jejunum/ileum + large intestine)
14. Negative Feedback Loops and Homeostasis
	1. Ex: Pancreas and Blood Sugar
		1. See graphic on slideshow
		2. Liver stores glycogen (complex carb)
		3. Can be hydrolyzed to release glucose into blood for energy
		4. When glucose levels drop below level, pancreases releases glucagon to liver for glycogen breakdown
		5. As blood glucose level rises, negative feedback stops glycogen breakdown
		6. Rise in glucose levels after a meal stimulates pancreas to release insulin
		7. Cells need insulin to get sugar inside them
		8. Metabolic energy production, fat synthesis, and glycogen synthesis causes blood glucose level to drop, resulting in end of insulin production (negative feedback)

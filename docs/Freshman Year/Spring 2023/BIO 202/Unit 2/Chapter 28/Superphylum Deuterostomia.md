1. Phylogenetics
	1. Metazoans -> Bilateral -> Eucoelomates -> Deuterostomes (mouth second; blastopore develops into anus)
2. Shared traits
	1. Mouth second
		1. Blastopore -> anus
	2. Archenteron -> gut
	3. Radial cleavage pattern 
	4. Triploblastic & most are bilateral 
3. Special traits
	1. More developed coelom
	2. Endoskeleton (instead of exoskeleton)
4. Phylum of interest
	1. Echinodermata
	2. Chordata
5. Phylum Echinoderms
	1. Name = "prickly skin"
	2. Ex: sea stars
	3. Most shared traits
		1. Larva are bilateral but adults exhibit pentaradial symmetry (can be divided into fives)
			1. No cephalization 
		2. Triploblastic
		3. Eucoelomates 
		4. Water vascular system
		5. Endoskeleton of CaCO3
		6. Pedicellaria
			1. Prevents things from settling and growing on them
			2. ---
	4. More characteristics
		1. Ossicles on skin
		2. Oral vs aboral surface
			1. Oral = mouth surface (on bottom)
			2. Aboral = top surface (on top)
		3. Organs in arms
		4. Two stomachs
			1. Uses one to shove out of body and eat
		5. Dioecious
		6. Fragmentation
		7. Autonomize
			1. Defensive mechanism so that if a part of leg is chopped off, it's okay
			2. Form of fragmentation (asexual)
	5. Class Asteroidea
		1. Sea stars
		2. Thick arms
		3. Central disk
		4. Mollusk carnivores
		5. Invert stomach to eat
		6. Tube feet are used for movement
	6. Class Ophiuroidea
		1. Name = "snake tails"
			1. Serpentine arms
		2. Called brittle stars
			1. Readily autonomize their arms
			2. Get rid of arms if stressed
		3. Long flexible arms
		4. Demarcated disk
		5. Use arms for movement
		6. Often seen in reefs
	7. Class Echinoidea
		1. Sea urchins and sand dollars
			1. Ex: diadema have very sharp spines 
		2. Use tube feet to move
		3. Aristotle's lantern
			1. Specialized structure in the mouth
			2. Feeding structures
		4. Detritivores
			1. Eat algae
	8. Class Holothuroidea
		1. Sea cucumbers
		2. Can spew out guts if stressed
			1. Get away from predator
		3. Elongated axes
		4. Bilateral adults
		5. Respiratory trees
		6. Tube feet for movement
		7. Tentacles used for feeding
	9. Class Crinoidea
		1. Sea lilies and feather stars
		2. Sessile
		3. Suspension feeders
		4. Branched arms
		5. Tube feet for food
		6. Extensive fossils
			1. Used to be more diverse
				1. Especially during Cambrian Period and Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras
			2. ---
		7. Many spp in Antarctica

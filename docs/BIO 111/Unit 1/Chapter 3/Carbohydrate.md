I. Monosaccharide
	A. OH = hydroxyl group
	B.  Model
		- Points on hexagons represent C atoms
		- Labeled in order starting from right side point
	C. A single monomer
		- Can link each monosaccharide
			a. Assemble polymers by dehydration synthesis
				i. Assembly requires losing a [[Water]] molecule
				ii. Adding [[Water]] molecules breaks bonds into two monomers (hydrolysis)
				iii. Creates a disaccharide (two monomers together)
	D. Glucose and fructose are most common
		- Ribose also important
			a. Ring structure but 6 C
	E. Disomer 
		- Suffix "ose" means its a carbohydrate
			- Fructose, glycose, maltose
		- Prefix indicates number
			- a. Ex: "Octo" = 8
		- Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all hexoses and monosaccharides
			- Structural isomers (same chemical formula) but different arrangement
			- Can be linked into polysaccharides
	F. Hydroxyl groups can be above or below ring in model
		A. If above, it is beta (b) type
		B. If below, it is alpha (a) type
		C. Ring forms when the side chain it closes on is locked into one of these two positions
	A. Bond holds glucose and fructose together in dehydration reaction
		- Creates sucrose
		- [[Water]] molecule lost in process
	B. Glycosidic Bond can be below the rings or above the rings
	C. Common disaccharides include maltose, lactose, and sucrose
		- If you can't break bond, you can't metabolize it
	D. Wherever you have a bond, you have potential energy
		- Sugars used for energy
	E. Polysaccharides
		- Carbs can be linear or highly branched
			a. If linear, glycosidic bonds between Carbon 1 and Carbon 4
			b. If branched, glycosidic bonds between Carbon 1 and Carbon 6
		- Amylose
			a. Composed of unbranched (linear) chains of glucose monomers connected by 1,4 glycosidic link
		- Amylopectin is composed of branched chains of glucose monomers connected by alpha 1,4 and alpha 1,6 glycosidic link
			a. Helical structure
			b. Glycogen similar in structure to amylopectin but more highly branched
		- Cellulose
			a. Made up of glucose linked in linear chains by B 1-4 glycosidic linkages
				i. We cannot digest B 1-4 glycosidic bonds
				ii. Dietary fiber
					~ Cannot digest (break it apart)
		- Chitin
			a. Large complex carb that makes hard exoskeleton in insects
			b. [[Water]] insoluble

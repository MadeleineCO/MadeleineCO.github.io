1. [[Domestication]]
	- Mouflon = original wild sheep
	- Bred for meat, milk, leather, fiber, [[Wool]], hair
	- Only need to control a few to control the herd
		1. Wide variety of products
		2. Not too large
2. [[Herbivores]]
3. [[Sheep and Goats]]
	- Among earliest [[Domestication|domesticated]]
		1. Herd-oriented
		2. Not self-domesticated
			- Intentional [[Domestication]]
		3. Smaller
		4. Lots of product
			- Meat, fiber, leather
	- Terms
		1. Parturition = lambing 
		2. Intact male = ram
		3. Castrated male = wether
		4. Female = ewe
		5. Young male = ram lamb
		6. Young female = ewe lamb
		7. All young = lambs
	- Mouflon
		1. Ancestor of all sheep
		2. Developed domesticated sheep from wild mouflon
	- Reproduction ([[Female Reproduction]] & [[Male Reproduction]])
		1. Seasonal breeders
			- Short day breeders
			- Only have estrous cycles as light decreases and darkness increases over a 24 hr period
				1. Fall/winter in northern hemisphere
					- Dec 21 is the equinox (NH) and the peak
				2. Anestrous = without estrus
					- Spring/summer in northern hemisphere
		1. Normally 17 day [[Estrus Cycle and Parturition Process|estrous cycle]]
		2. Estrus = 30 hours
		3. Gestation = 147 days
			- Lambing in spring as forage starts growing
		4. Puberty = 6-8 months
		5. Life cycle
			- Day 0 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
			- Day 147 (lambing from Mar to Apr)
				1. Castration of most males
				2. Young animal vaccinations 
			- Day 200 (weaning from May to June)
				1. Weaning = Process of separation of the dam and offspring  
			- Day 260 (market lambs from July to Aug for meat producing animals)
				1. Market lambs = lambs sold to meat market
				2. Around July or August
				3. Meat lambs, not [[Wool]] lambs
				4. Get rid of castrated males and most of ewe lambs
					- Must keep some for breeding
			- Day 365 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
				1. Cycle repeats
	- Types of sheep
		1. [[Wool]]
		2. Meat
			- Often called farm flock
			- Selected for carcass and growth characteristic
			- Medium quality [[Wool]]
				1. Greater diameter (not as fine)
			- 250-400 lbs.
			- Midwest and Northeast
			- Suffolk
			- Hampshire
			- Can have black pigmentation
				1. Limits dying ability
			- Shear in the spring but toss wool
				1. Only for cooling/sheep comfort 
			- Southdown 
		3. Hair Breeds
			- Meat
			- Milk
			- Leather
			- Subtropical to tropical environment
				1. Selected for parasite, disease resistance
				2. Adapted to hot, humid environment
			- Barbados blackbelly
			- Katahdin
				1. What we have
				3. Gulf coast natives
					- From Katahdin
					- Southeast
				4. 1957 - Maine - Three lines of African based hair breeds via Virgin Islands
					- Bred in virgin islands then brought to northeast
				5. Treat once every 8-15 months based off need
		4. Diversity
			- Jacob sheep
				1. 4-8 Big horns
			- Shetland
				1. Small and fluffy
			- Han
				1. Small tail han
				2. Large tail han (fat tail)
					- Tail is delicacy 
			- Many other different breeds
	- [[Wool]] Production
	- Distribution of US Sheep
		1. Fewest sheep in the South (hot + humid)
		3. Farm flocks mostly in Midwest and Northwest
		4. Larger flocks in west w/ mostly wool sheep
		5. Sheep numbers have dramatically dropped in the US
			- Both meat and wool types
			- We don't eat much lamb in the US
			- Other countries such as New Zealand and Iceland consume much more
			- The older the sheep, the stronger the flavor
				1. Lamb is young
				2. Mutton is older sheep (strong flavor)
			- WW II - Had mostly lamb in the war
				1. Conditioned aversion
				2. Soldiers didn't want lamb after returning
			- We tend to associate lamb with Christmas and Easter
				1. Associated w/ holiday meals
				2. Production vs Demand
					- We market in July-Aug
					- When we want lamb, it's not available in northern hemisphere
						1. Comes from southern hemisphere making it expensive
					- We don't produce lamb when desired (seasonal breeders)
						1. Consequently, we import lamb, increasing the cost
				- Wool production has challenges as well
					1. Increased utilization of synthetic fibers such as polyester and nylon
						- Oil derivatives
						- Less expensive
					2. Raise wool sheep in large flocks in the west
						- Must constantly move them to have enough grass
						- Purpose of shepherd
							1. Hard job and lifestyle
							2. Isolation and seclusion
					3. Predation is an issue as well
						- Sheep are small and make easier prey
						- Most sheep lost to cayotes 
							1. Kill about 75% of sheep lost to predation
						 - 52% cause of death
						 - Hunting can control them, but very difficult
							 1. Ultralights w/ guns
					4. Import 70% of wool consumed
					5. Imported 273 million lbs. in 2018
					6. Contract grazing
						- Use sheep to graze lawn then use wool to give to Salvation army
						- Sheep in vineyards to eat grass but unlike goats, leave grapes alone (unless all of grass gone)
						- Solar farms helping to keep grass levels down (goats would mess solar equipment up but sheep leave it mostly alone)

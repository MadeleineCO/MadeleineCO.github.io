1. Respiration
	1. Convert [[energy]]
	2. Autotrophs
		- Able to produce their own organic molecules through photosynthesis
		- Plants, sea anemone, etc.
	3. Heterotrophs
		- Live on organic compounds produced by other organisms
		- Fungi, animals, etc.
	5. Cellular respiration is a series of reactions ([[Metabolism]])
		- Oxidations = loss of electrons
			- Products lower in [[energy]] (exergonic)
		- Reduction = the reverse of oxidation
			- Products higher in [[energy]] (endergonic)
		- Dehydrogenations = lost electrons are accompanied by protons
			- A hydrogen atom is lost (1 electron, 1 proton)
2. Redox
	1. During redox reactions, electrons carry [[energy]] from one molecule to another
		- One thing gets oxidized (loses electron and lower in energy) and the other gets reduced (gains electron and higher in energy)
	2. Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+)
		- Special dinucleotide than is an electron carrier
			- Only two nucleotide linked together with sugar and two phosphates
		- NAD+ accepts 2 electrons and 1 proton to become NADH
			- Reaction is reversible
		- NAD+ is oxidized form. NADH is reduced form
			- NADH has more [[energy]] (reduced the charge because it has another electron
			- NAD+ (lost electron and lower in energy, but more positive)
			- NADH has two hydrogen and HAD+ has one hydrogen
3. In overall cellular energy harvest. . . .
	1. Dozens of redox reactions take place
		- Two reactants and two products w/ one being higher in energy (reduced) and one being lower in energy (oxidized)
	2. Num of electron accepters including NAD+
	3. In the end, high-energy electrons from initial chemical bonds have lost much of their energy
		- Energy transferred to a final electron acceptor
4. [[Aerobic Respiration]]		
	1. Uses oxygen
5. Oxidation without O2
	1. [[Anaerobic Respiration]]
6. [[Fermentation]]

1. Animal [[cell|cells]] each have centrosome and lysosomes, whereas plants cells do not
	1. Lysosome: like digestive stomach; can take, fuse with, and break down digested material
		- Contain digestive enzymes
		- Destroys cells that cell has engulfed by phagocytosis
		- Inside is very acid ([[Acids and bases]])
			- Has proteins that pump H+ ions into protein to lower the pH
				- Ex: white blood cells can engulf enemies. lysosomes destroy them
	1. Centrosome: Associated w/ microtubules; like railways throughout the [[cell]]
		- Microtubules make the railways
		- Vesicles are shipped on the railways
2. Plant [[cell|cells]] have a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and large central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not
		1. [[Cell]] wall
			- Composed of cellulose held by glycosidic bonds ([[Carbohydrate]])
				- We cannot break the glycosidic bonds, so cellulose is not digestible
		1. ---
		2. Chloroplasts
			- Inner membranes and outer membranes
			- Converts sunlight into sugars

A back of a skull was found in ---::Pakastan in 1978; Similar to back of skull of wolf but had walnut sized lump on back as apart of inner ear (only found in whales)
^1674070222305

Paleontologists searched for transitional whale forms in the ---::Sahara; 40 mil yrs ago, the Sahara was part of the sea; "Valley of Whales" once a protected bay (whales could have birthed young and died there)
^1674070222312

Aquatic mammal ancestry is evident in the ways they ---::move; Mammals such as otters and whales ungulate spine up and down in the same way that land animals do
^1674070222335

Land animals were a product of ---::aquatic animals first; Shift from life in water to life on land as reptiles, birds, and mammals all come from early tetrapods; Common ancestor transitioned 370 mil yrs ago in the Devonian period
^1674070222342

The cliffs of PA were once under a ---::stream; About the age of when the first tetrapods evolved; Found smaller shoulder bone of an early tetrapod (bc found in stream bed, probably lived in water)
^1674070222349

Early tetrapods developed --- first then left the water::fingers; Fossils found in Greenland w/ forelimbs + hands (called Kansasdenger), fish-like tails and gills, and pedal-shaped ends of arms

Fish fins follow the same arm/wrist/hand pattern of ---::human hands
^1674070222365

During the time of early tetrapods, there was competition for survival in ---::small streams; Experiments for different survival strategies, including escaping to land; Beginning of land evolution
^1674070222371

A transformation occurred 1/2 billion yrs ago that led to ---::all animals; Animals appeared 570 million yrs ago in a short burst called the Cambrian explosion
^1674083386346

In 1913 in the Canadian Rockies, layers of shale containing thousands of --- was discovered::sea-dweller fossils; Trilobites are extinct arthropods w/ external skeletons; Other alien-looking animals, but all had bodies w/ tails, heads, appendages, etc
^1674083386358

Pikaia::Only fossil found in the Canadian Rockies among the others that had an internal nerve cord resembling a spine; Precursor of fish and so on
^1674083386366

All animals are variations of the ---::same theme; Evolution only tinkers w/ genes
^1674083386373

Embryos and how animals evolve::Start out as clusters of nearly identical cells; Partitions into specialized segments
^1674083386379

Skeletons have underlying structure of ---::repeating segments; Embryonic development studied by William Bateson
^1674083386385

Animals occasionally develop w/ things in ---::wrong places; Disruption w/ underlying blueprint; Random changes that might provide fuel for evolution
^1674083386392

Disruption of DNA can occur through ---::radiation, poison, etc; DNA causes embryos to divide into segments and it is made up of genes
^1674083386399

Lewis proposed that single --- direct development in fruit flies (and other organisms)::genes; Couldn't isolate genes at the time
^1674083386406

Antennapedia = ---::antenna leg; Gene thought to control leg growth (if disrupted, legs appeared in the wrong places)
^1674083386413

Radioactive probes and toxic enzymes can track ---::individual genes
^1674083386420

Thorax gene is like master switch that turns on ---::part of embryo that is to become the main body
^1674083386427

Scientists isolated the "eyeless gene" that triggers development of ---::eyes in fruit flies; Gene in mice acts the same way; Mouse gene can be put into fruit flies and eyes develop normally (use same mechanism and gene)
^1674083386435

Evolution works w/ packets of ---::info and new combinations; Same set of genes
^1674083386441

Human transformation::From trees to ground over 4 mil yrs of evolution; Two legged walking compared to "knuckle walking" of our closest living relative, the chimp
^1674083386448

Movement style of lemurs::Lemur spines are extremely flexible; Early ancestor wasn't limited to one motion and could evolve in different ways; Today, human skeletons are specialized for two legged walking, chimp skeletons are specialized for knuckle walking, but lemurs can preform many different movements
^1674083386455

The Galapagos islands are home to unique species, most notably --- species noticed by Darwin::finch; Today, 13 different species of finches in diverse habitats as islands are very different from each other; Different beaks for different food sources
^1674083386462

Galapagos islands are --- islands that are geologically ---::volcanic; young; Separated from mainland, but one finch species made it to the islands from SA and evolved into the many finch species we see today
^1674083386468

A drought lasted for 18 months on the G. islands and vegetation disappeared. In response, the finches turned to ---::increasingly large seeds, which required large beaks; Birds w/ smallest beaks had most trouble and over 80% of medium ground finches died; Surviving medium ground finches had larger beaks; Avg beak sized increased in population
^1674083386474

Five yrs after the drought, the G. islands experienced 10x more rain than usual. Rain changed vegetation so finches turned to ---::smaller seeds as larger seeds became scarce when drought struck later; Finches w/ small beaks survived and offspring had smaller beaks on avg
^1674083386482

Species::A group that cannot interbreed w/ other populations
^1674083386489

What keeps different species of finches from mating?::Species have different songs that attract males of the same species; Males are also attracted to females that have similar beaks and size; Sexual selection
^1674083386496

2 mil yrs ago, a single finch species reached the ---::G. islands then faced new conditions and became isolated; Traits changed over time; If traits involved mating factors, then species became more isolated and considered new species
^1674083386503

Adaptive radiation::A rapid increase in the num of species w/ a common ancestor, characterized by great ecological and morphological diversity; Driving force is the adaptation of organisms to new ecological contexts; Ex: one finch species -> many spp on the G. islands
^1674083386510

Whale Valley is an archeological site located in the Sahara Desert. How could there be whale skulls there?::Millions of years ago, the whale valley was underwater
^1675016470680

The Cambrian Explosion is thought to have occurred around 500 mya. What best describes the Cambrian Explosion?::A sudden appearance in the fossil record of many unique animal species
^1675016470688

What caused the number of birds on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island) to change (decrease then increase) over the time that the Grants have been studying them?::Changes in rain levels, such as a drought
^1675016470696

When human ancestors came out of the trees and started to live life on the ground, it allowed a change to happen that had a significant impact on the evolutionary trajectory of hominids. What was that change?::Walking upright freed up their hands
^1675016470704

When the mouse "eyeless" gene was implanted into fruit flies, what happened?::The mouse gene worked perfectly

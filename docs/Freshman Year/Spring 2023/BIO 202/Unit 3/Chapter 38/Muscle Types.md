1. Skeletal 
	1. "voluntary"
	2. Striated, multinucleate
2. Cardiac
	1. Self-initiating 
		1. You can be brain dead but your heart still beats 
	2. Striated, uninucleate
	3. Found in heart *only*
3. Smooth
	1. "involuntary"
	2. Found in walls of organs 
		1. Lines esophagus, SI, stomach, arteries, veins, etc.
	3. Can become inflamed
		1. Ex: asthma
4. Vertebrate Skeletal Muscle
	1. Skeletal muscle
	2. Contains bundles of muscle fibers 
		1. Ex: bicept
	3. Muscle fiber (cell)
		1. Nucleus 
		2. Sarcolemma
			1. Refers to the cell membrane of a muscle cell 
		3. Myofibril 
			1. ---
			2. Contains myofilaments
				1. Actin (thin) and Myosin (thick)
					1. Cytoskeletal components
				2. Protein filaments 
			3. Sarcomere
				1. Smallest working subunit of muscular contraction 
					1. Z-line - actin connects to the sides and myosin in the middle
						1. See graphic ---
					2. Interacts w/ protein
					3. Very small
				2. Pulls everything inside or extending everything 
	4. Neuromuscular Synapse and Muscular Contraction
		1. See graphic ---
		2. Action potential reaches neuromuscular junction
		3. Ca^2+ enters the pre-s.c. cell
		4. Exocytosis of ACh (NT)
		5. ACh binds to muscle cell
			1. Na+ enters the post-s.c. cell
		6. T-tubule
			1. Depolarizes
			2. ---
		7. Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
			1. Stores Ca+ 
			2. When depolarization occurs, Ca^2+ is released
		8. Muscle contraction then occurs 
		9. Ca^2+ pumps calcium back into the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
			1. This stops the muscle contraction 
	5. Regulation of Muscular Contraction
		1. Tropomyosin (TPM)
			1. Found on actin (main myofilament)
			2. Blocks binding sites
		2. Troponin (TPN)
			1. Found on actin and TPM
			2. Holds actin and tropomyosin
		3. Calcium (Ca^2+)
			1. Low = TPM inhibits cross-bridge and blocks binding sites
				1. Prevents myosin from binding
			2. High = TPN changes conformation and exposes binding sites 
				1. Conformation change pulls TPM away so that myosin can then bind
			3. See graphic ---
	6. Sliding Filament Theory
		1. "sliding" of myofilaments to contract sarcomeres 
		2. See graphic ---
		3. Myosin and actin slide past each other to create muscular contradiction
			1. Filaments within the sarcomeres
			2. A small but measurable distance
		4. Singerly, one sarcomere doesn't do much, but wholistically can contract the entire muscle
		5. Calcium is around from depolarization of neuron
			1. Trypanin and Tropomyosin are regulatory
			2. Increase in calcium results in changing TPN conformation so that myosin can bind
		6. Process
			1. Ca^2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
			2. Ca^2+ in the sarcoplasm binds troponin and exposes myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments
			3. Myosin heads bind to actin
			4. Release of Pi initiates power stroke
			5. In the power stroke, the myosin head changes conformation so that filaments slide past one another
			6. ADP is released at the end of the power stroke and ATP binds back to myosin, causing it to release actin
			7. Hydrolysis of ATP returns the myosin head to its "cocked position"
			8. If Ca^2+ remains available, the cycle repeats and contraction continues
			9. If Ca^2+ is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes
		7. Must have ATP available
			1. If dead, no ATP is available and muscles stiffen
				1. No ATP to break the crossbridge
			2. Interaction of myosin and --- called crossbridge
		8. All happens at sarcomeric level
	7. Muscle Twitch Response
		1. Can measure muscle by force in response to stimulus over time
			1. Can stimulate muscles using electricity
		2. See graphs ---
		3. Eventually reaches platue where muscle cannot contract any more despite the stimulus
			1. As tense as it can be
			2. Called muscular tetanus 
				1. *Clostridium tetani* causes muscles to contract and not relax (esp. facial muscles so that you cannot eat)
					1. This bacteria is anaerobic (no O^2)
	8. Skeletal Muscle Fibers
		1. Slow-twitch
			1. "Red-muscle"
			2. Rich capillary supply
			3. High mitochondrial density
			4. Aerobic respiratory enzymes
			5. High in myoglobin (respiratory pigment)
			6. The endurance muscle
		2. Fast-twitch
			1. "White muscle"
			2. Lower capillary supply
			3. Lower mitochondrial density
			4. Anaerobic respiratory enzymes
				1. Lactic acid -> cramps
			5. Lower in myoglobin
			6. Bursts 
		3. Real World Example of Fiber Types
			1. Marathon athlete = high concentration of slow-twitch fibers
			2. Middle distance athlete = even concentration
			3. Sprinter = high concentration of fast-twitch
			4. Birds
				1. Fast-twitch for getting off the ground (breast meat)
				2. Slow-twitch for endurance

1. Cattle Terms
	- ---
2. [[Domestication]]
	- [[Cattle (Bovine)]]
		1. Synthetics = Breeds created from cross breeding other breeds
			- ---
		2. Purebred = Defined set of characteristics of an animal that are passed from parent to offspring
			- 250 breeds recognized 
			- >300 varieties and types not given "names"
			- We decide the characteristics of what counts as a certain breed
			- Genetically, tend to be more homozygous genes 
			- Types 
				1. Two major species (taurus or indicus)
				2. European - Bos taurus (genus + species)
					- Moderately sized (1000-1500 lbs.)
					- Characteristics
						1. Carcass quality = Amount of meat and quality of meat
						2. Maternal ability = Care for offspring (including milk-production)
						3. Reproduction = Ability to reproduce (any major problems) 
						4. Sows = Also milk production (human use)
				3. Continental - Bos taurus
					- Large breed
					- Used for meat, milk, and draft
						1. Similar characteristics as Europeans but also used for draft
				4. Zebu - Bos indicus
					- Commonly known as humped cattle
					- Used for meat (although lower quality and quantity than European and Continental), Milk, and Draft
					- Subtropical + Tropical climates
						1. Shiny hair that reflects sun (increases sun reflection for cooling)
						2. Have more hair fibers (allows them to sweat better by increasing surface area)
						3. Increase in body surface area (more skin surface area helps w/ cooling)
						4. Large ears (allow for better cooling)
						5. More resistant to parasites and disease
					- Ex: Brahman (American breed w/ SA and India roots)
				5. Synthetic = Breeds developed by crossing established breeds until a point is reached of being a purebred
					- Brangus = Angus + Brahman
					- Simbrah = Brahman + Shorthorn
						1. More heat tolerance and better carcass
	- Why have so many breeds? 
		1. With beef, we are trying to find animals that are best suited to natural environments
			- With dairy, only 5 major breeds bc we try to alter the environmental conditions for the animal
		2. [[Cattle (Bovine)|Cattle]] nums increases until about 1972, then dropped
			- Used to go through waves of increasing and decreasing numbers
			- Numbers now dropping
		3. [[Cattle (Bovine)|Cattle]] is centralized in the Midwest bc land is not available for other uses such as crops
			- Top states w/ most cattle
				1. Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, California, Oklahoma, Missouri
				2. 60% around Nebraska-Iowa area
				3. Infrastructure mostly in Midwest as well
			- Beef is fourth most valuable commodity in GA
3. [[Beef Infrastructure]]
4. [[Female Reproduction|Reproduction]]
	- Estrous cycle = 21 days
	- Estrus = 12 hours
	- Gestation = 285 days
	- Nonseasonal - polyestrous 
		1. Can have estrous cycles year-round
	- Life cycle
		1. Either spring calving or fall calving (uniform groups)
		2. Spring calving
			- Day 0 (april/may/june) = breeding
			- Day 285 (feb, march, april) = calving
				1. 6-8 weeks = Spring work
					- Involves branding, dehorning, castration, vaccinations
				2. Sept/Oct = Fall work
					- Weaning (5-7 months, 400-600 lbs.)
					- Pregnancy check cows
					- After this, 40% of heifers are kept as replacement breeders while steers and other 60% are sold to stocker industry
			- Day 365 (april/may/june) = breeding
			- ---
		3. Heifer Breeding Season
			- Cow/calf operations start virgin heifers one month before cow herd (march for spring cycle)
				1. Virgin heifer = easiest to breed
				2. 1st calf heifer = hardest to breed
					- After virgin female has first calf
					- Lactation, Carowing
				3. Advantages of starting a month earlier
					- Virgin heifers easiest to breed but have highest rate of dystocia
						1. Still growing (birth weight to size issue)
						2. If bred month early, you can focus on them calving without having to worry about the rest of the herd
					- If they are calving a month earlier, they get an extra month to recover before being rebred in the cow herd
						1. Extra month to recover from uterine involution and lactation anestrous 
		4. They are non-seasonal polyestrous (estrous cycles year-round), but we want uniformity
			- Choose either spring calving or fall calving 
				1. Advantages of spring calving
					- Weather
					- Nutrition (Forages start growing in spring)
				2. Disadvantage of spring calving
					- More supply bc spring is more ideal for weather and nutrition
						1. Causes value to go down
						2. Supply vs demand
				3. Advantages of fall calving
					- Greater value bc less supply and more demand
					- Can be done in South, but most operations choose spring calving
				4. Disadvantages of fall calving 
					- Weather is usually worse
					- Forage is not growing in the fall (downside for nutrition)
						1. My have to feed more, which would cost more

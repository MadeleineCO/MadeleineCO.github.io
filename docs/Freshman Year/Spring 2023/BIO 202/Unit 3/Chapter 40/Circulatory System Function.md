1. Transportation
	1. Nutrients and glucose
	2. Metabolic wastes
2. Regulation
	1. Carries hormones
	2. Temperature (dil/con)
		1. Dilation = more open
			2. Cooling 
		2. Constriction = more closed
			1. Conserves heat
3. Protection 
	1. Injury and clotting
		1. Platelets
		2. Ticks prevent proteins from clotting properly so they can continuously feed
	2. Pathogens and WBCs
		1. Immune system
4. Invertebrate Circulatory Systems
	1. Sponges have no true tissues
		1. Surrounded by water
		2. Specialized cells bring water in the ostia and out the ostium
		3. Every cell must be in contact
	2. GVC
		1. Seen in flatworms and cnidarians
		2. Most cells in contact w/ water
		3. Two-cells thick
	3. Nematodes ---
		1. Body fluids act as circulatory fluid
		2. Pseudocoelomate
		4. Small size so that cells can maintain contact
	4. Open Circulation
		1. Seen in arthropods
		2. No distinction between body fluids and circulatory fluids
			1. Hemolymph (combined fluids)
		3. Heart -> fluid -> channels and cavities
		4. Drains back to heart
	5. Closed (complete) circulatory system
		1. First seen in annelids 
		2. Completely separate circulatory fluid
		3. Heart -> arteries -> tissues
			1. Oxygenated
		4. Tissues -> veins -> heart
			1. Deoxygenated
5. Fish (CCS)
	1. Two chambered heart
		1. Advantage = Keeps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separate
	2. Efficient gills
	3. Systematic loop only
		1. Unidirectional flow
	4. Disadvantage = low blood pressure
	5. Electrical impulse (SV)
		1. Sinosphinoses 
			1. ---
		2. Heart initiates its own electrical stymulation
	6. ![[Pasted image 20230417111912.png]]
6. Amphibians
	1. Three chambered heart
	2. Double circulation
		1. Systematic (body)
		2. Pulmonary (lungs)
		3. Cutaneous (skin)
			1. Smooth, thin skin
	3. Blood mixture occurs in the ventricle 
		1. Nearly complete but not quite
		2. Decreases efficiency
	4. Electrical impulse (SV)
		1. Sinoatrial node in the right atrium
	5. Limits thermal regulation and metabolic rate
		1. Low MR

7. Non avian and non crocodilian reptiles
	1. Three chambered heart
	2. Partial septum
	3. Double circulation
		1. Systemic 
		2. Pulmonary
	4. Some, but very little blood mixing
		1. Nearly separate
	5. Can shunt blood to certain areas
		1. Increases efficiency
		2. When basking, can shunt blood to warm up
	6. Low metabolism (not separate all the time) and rely on behavioral temp regulation
	7. graphic ---
8. Crocs, Birds, and Mammals
	1. 4 chambered heart
	2. Complete separation
		1. No blood mixing
		2. Greater efficiency
	3. Double loop
		1. Systemic 
		2. Pulmonary
	4. Sinoatrial node (in RA)
		1. ---
	5. Endothermic and higher metabolic rate
		1. More internal regulation 
		2. No blood mixing helps us maintain body temp

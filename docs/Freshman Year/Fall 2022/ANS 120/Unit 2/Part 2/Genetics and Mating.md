1. [[Genetics]]
	- Natural selection determines best genes in the wild
	- Humans specialize breeding and select traits
	- [[What is Animal Science]]
2. Inbreeding = mating of individuals that are more closely related than the average of the population 
	- Linebreeding focuses on specific individuals
		1. Concentrates genes of a particular ancestor
		2. Ex: racehorses (fast gene + fast gene)
	- Basis for development of breeds
		1. Long nosed dog + long nosed dog are likely more closely related
		2. Breeds have similar characterizes compared to avg of species
	- Does *not* increase or cause mutations
		1. It increases expression of genes by increasing homozygosity 
			- Increase expressions of possible problems as well as other gene expressions
		2. Does not make or mutate new genes 
		3. Combining gene carriers of mutations more bc not as random
	- We specifically inbreed for specific genes
3. Outbreeding = mating individuals that are less related than the average of the population 
	- Some chickens that are very different than most of its own species
	- Different breeds of cows that are in same species
	- Crossing species = breeding two different species
		1. Usually doesn't work
		2. Species not really supposed to breed 
		3. Different numbers of chromosomes 
		4. Horse (64 chromosomes) x Donkey (62 chromosomes) = mule (chromosomal count depends on cell)
			- No genetic fitness = No ability to pass on genes and reproduce
			- Called a chimera (mixture of generally incompatible chromosomes or chromosome numbers)
			- Some cells have 63 chromosomes, some have 62 and others have 64
		5. Bison + Cattle = Beefalo
			- 3/8 bison or less
			- Higher % bison = poor reproduction
			- Same number of chromosomes (60) but still problematic
		6. Can cross horse w/ zebra and can cross lion w/ tiger
			- Zoos don't want this to happen
				1. Want to maintain genetic integrity of their animals
			- Problematic 
	- Crossing breeds together within species
	- Outcrossing within breeds
		1. Can have same breed, but less related than avg of population bc they are so genetically different
		2. Mainly seen in poultry and swine
		3. Pretty rare
	- Heterosis = When the average of a trait in offspring is superior to the average of parental breeds
		1. The main reason for outbreeding
			- Meat animals have high heterosis in reproductive traits and generally no problems w/ other important traits (more efficient repro without many other consequences)
		2. Expression of the offspring in a given trait is higher than the average of the parental breeds
		3. Not the average of the parents, but the parental breeds as a whole
		4. No heterosis ex: Breed A has 500 unit expression of a gene and Breed B has 520 unit expression of the gene. Offspring has 510 unit expression of the gene.
		5. Heterosis ex: Breed A has 90 units of expression and Breed B has 90 units of expression. Offspring has 92 units of expression. (No heterosis would mean offspring is also 90 units)
	- Outbreeding/Crossbreeding tends to be used in meat producing species (ex beef, swine, broiler chickens, meat breeds of sheep/goats)
		1. Crossbreeding enhances reproduction and favorable (or at least not detrimental influence on other traits)
			- More efficient reproduction by 2 or 3% can be huge difference
			- Bettering reproduction without screwing overall animal up
		2. Little to no crossbreeding is used in other production animals such as wool sheep, horses, dairy, and egg production
			- Enhances reproduction but often has less desirable influences on other traits
		3. Crossbreeding sometimes occurs in pets
			- Possibly for show/preference reasons
4. Selection = Deciding the parents of the next generation
	- Natural mating
		1. Can only take male so many places
		2. Harder on large scale
	- Artificial Insemination
		1. Moves genes more quickly than natural mating
		2. Freezing semen for decades
		3. Easy to transport
		4. Very difficult and repro rates lower
			- 50% considered good
		5. Turkeys, dairy cows, swine, some chickens
	- Embryo Transfer
		1. Superovulate the female 
			- Hormone treatments that alter the number of follicles that develop
			- Several follicles ovulate
		2. Take the embryos out of uterus and put them in recipients
			- Cow can produce 8 calves and not carry any of them
			- Allows you to perpetuate superior genetics
		3. Used some in dairy cows
			- Can upgrade multiple cows at once
	- Embryo splitting
		1. Take zona pellucida from embryo (take out genetic material inside) 
		2. Then split zona pellucia and put half of good genetic material from another cell in both so you have two embryos with same genetics
		3. Like forced twinning
		4. Take embryos and put them in other recipients 
		5. Used some in dairy cows
		6. Very low success rate
4. Triploidy
	- Normal reproduction has one haploid sperm w/ one haploid ovum
		1. Combine to form diploid chromosome
		2. Meiosis = Formation of diploid embryo from haploid gametes 
			- Interrupt 2nd meiotic division of egg
	- Triploid = 3 halves (like 1.5 chromosome)
		1. Mates normal sperm but two sets of haploid female chromosomes
		2. Interrupt meiosis to where you end up w/ triploid chromosome 
	- Can use in fish
		1. Ovulation occurs outside body and don't finish meiosis until down w/ ovulation
		2. Makes it easier for us to interrupt 2nd meiosis 
	- No genetic fitness and no reproduction, but rapid/prolonged growth
		1. Can't become invasive 
			- Don't want grass carb to become invasive
			- Ex grass harp from Russia
		1. Can become very large
			- If sexual maturity isn't reached, they don't stop growing
			- No genetic fitness, no sexual maturity
	- Most animals do not survive this
5. Cloning = Creating a new embryo from an existing cell of an organism
	- Take fertilized egg and remove nucleus from frog A
		1. Enucleate egg by destroying nucleus 
	- Take fully differentiated skin cell and the nucleus from the skin cell from frog B
	- Combine egg w/ transplanted nucleus to get clone of frog B
	- Dolly the sheep
		1. Took donor egg from black-faced sheep and removed the nucleus then fused cell from white-faced sheep and enucleated egg w/ electricity
		2. Implanted new embryo into black-faced sheep
		3. Lamb was clone of white-faced sheep
		4. 1 of 277 attempts
		5. Dolly died at young age and showed characteristic of older ewe
			- The older the animal, the more mutations, issues, etc. 
				1. Age causes genetic changes
	- Cloning your pet
		1. 40-50 thousand
		2. ViaGen
		3. Better results w/ younger animal
	- Cell (usually from mammary cell when lactating bc newer) --> Nucleus --> unfertilized enucleated ovum -->1 cell embryo planted in enucleated ovum donor 
	- Mammoth
		1. Take mammoth DNA and enucleated elephant ovum
		2. Present efforts

I. Element = Any substance that cannot be broken down to any other substance by ordinary chemical means
	A. 92 naturally occurring elements
		- Can create nonnaturally occuring elements in labs
			a. Unstable
II. Elements within columns share similar characteriscs 
	A. Metals
		- Strong conductors
	B. Metalloids
		- Semiconductors
	C. Gases
III. [[The Nature of Atoms]]
IV. Isotopes
	A. [[Atoms]] of a single element that possess different numbers of neutrons
		- Atoms can have different neutron num but always must have same proton num
	B. Radioactive isotopes are unstable and emit radiation as the nucleus breaks up
		- Half-life = time it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay
		- Lose neutrons as they decay
		- Can be relatively long or short
	C. Three isotopes of carbon
		- Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14
		- 12 (the atomic mass) is listed becomes it is most stable
			a. The most stable form of an element is listed on the table
	D. Different neutron nums creates different characteristics
V. [[Electrons]] and elements
	A. Arrangement
		- Valence electrons = number of electrons in outermost energy level
			a. Periodic table displays elements according to valence electrons
		- Inert (nonreative) elements have all eight electrons
			a. Octet rule = atoms tend to establish completely full outer energy levels
			b. Nobel gases
				i. In last column, the elements are all satisfied
					~ Helium has 2 electrons but is satisfied
					~ Other elements all have eight
				ii. Unreactive
		- Valence electrons increase 1 from column to column from 1-8
			a. Ignore lower middle area
			b. Electrons in 1st column are very reactive
				i. One electron away from satisfaction
					~ Need to get rid of single electron
			c. Electrons in 7th column are also very reactive
				i. One electron away from satisfaction
					~ Need to gain a single electron
		- Only 12 elements found in living organisms in substantial amounts
			a. Four elements make up 96.3% of human body weight
				i. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen
		- Organic molecules contain primarily CHON
		- Some trace elements are very important
			a. Sodium, Chlorine, Calcium, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Iron, Magnesium, etc.

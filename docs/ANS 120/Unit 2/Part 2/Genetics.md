1. We spend a lot of effort trying to save endangered species
2. Genetic improvement?
	- More like genetic change
	- Ideals change, but one not necessarily better than the other
	- Dairy production is more efficient due to genetic selection
	- Swine went from fat to lean as needs changed
	- 4x wool production today
	- Many more eggs in domestic chickens
	- Broilers chickens are for meat and are now have fast growing and slow growing breeds
		1. Must AI because breast is so big they cannot mate
	- Little change in beef production
	- No change in horse speed index in 40 years
3. Genetic diseases
	- Many more genetic diseases in horses
	- Many more in dogs as well
		1. Change in skull shape of British Bulldog over last 50 years has causes breathing problems
			- They must also have C-sections because head and shoulders are so large
	- Cats w/ smushed faces have breathing problems. Hairless cats have skin issues.
4. Linking genes to phenotype
	- P = G + E
		1. P = phenotype (physical appearance/expression of trait)
			- Ex: color, weight
			- Measurable
		2. G = genotype (genetic make-up)
			- DNA
		3. E = environment
			- Environment affects how genes are expressed
	- Genetic expression
		1. Simple Mendelian Genetics
			- Pea experiments
				1. Could predict outcome of offspring
			- Gene = a chunk of DNA that codes for a specific substance
				1. Made up of alleles (two subunits of DNA that make up genes)
		2. Dominance and Recessive
			- Horned (p) vs. Polled (P) in cattle
				1. Little p is recessive and big P is dominant
				2. Qualitative measure (discrete and few genes involved)
			- Quantitative = traits expressive other a wide range of values
				1. Many genes are involved
				2. Complex
			- [[Genetics and Mating]]
5. Transgenic = Inserting genes from one species into another species
	- Tobacco + Luciferase gene
		1. Luciferase gene from firefly
		2. Produced glowing tobacco
	- Mouse + hST
		1. Human growth hormone gene
		2. Problematic
			- Mouse grows too fast for skeleten
	- Salmon expirements
	- FIV virus research
		1. Macaque gene thought to protect against FIV virus 
		2. Inserted FIV virus w/ jellyfish gene
		3. Cat glowed under black light
	- Human lactoferin
		1. Cancer fighting agent
		2. Incorporated into sheep genome
		3. Protein would be expressed in milk
		4. Goal that animal will keep producing offspring w/ gene
6. DNA Fingerprinting
	- Genetic carriers
	- Identify individuals
		1. Pedigree verification
			- Do they carry bad gene?
		2. Theft recovery
			- Animals can look very alike but different unique
		3. Genomics
			- Predicts performance and heterosis
				1. Less related individuals will express greater hybrid vigor in offspring
			- Identify genes that influence milk so you can tell capability
				1. Don't have to wait years to tell
			- Could enhance heterosis 
				1. Crossing different lines
7. Epigenetics 
	- DNA is DNA but. . .
		1. Genes can be turned on or off as a result of environmental effects
	- The honeybee
		1. Genetic clones of the queen
		2. Environment can cause differences by activating different genes
			- Different diets (ex royal jelly vs worker jelly) can greatly change appearance 
			- Can be queen or worker despite genetically the same
8. Genetic engineering and manipulation 
	- Food production and environment
		1. Benefits
	- Medicine
		1. Benefits
	- With benefits come risks

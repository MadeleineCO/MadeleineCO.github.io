Population::All the individuals in one area at one time that may interbreed and exchange genes
^1674164659962

Population genetics::Evolution --> genes change; We can measure the genetic variation of individuals within a population over generations (measure dom vs rec alleles)
^1674164659971

Population genetics involves measuring genetic variation and identifying forces that ---::cause change; If changes compound, a new species may form
^1674164659977

Microevolution::The slow selective pressure that affects alleles in a population; Measurable (unlike macroevolution)
^1674164659985

[[2023-01-21]]
Phenotypic variation in populations::Varied expression in the same population; Individuals don't look identical, and on a less overt level, enzymes and proteins vary; Ex: feral horse populations (coloration differences in mustangs)
^1674336733281

Phenotypic variation can be caused by --- genes::single or multiple; Could be single difference, but more likely multiple genes are involved in the expression of the phenotype
^1674336733294

Natural selection applies pressure on ---::mutations (random mutations --> non-random selection); Mutations could be adaptive or maladaptive (adaptive generally stays while maladaptive may die off); Selected traits bc more common in a population
^1674336733301

Genetic drift occurs when ---::change alone shifts the phenotype of a population; Genes become more common over generations due to changes in environment; Ex: random natural disaster kills off black hares so brown hares become the dominant population
^1674336733309

Gene flow occurs when ---::new alleles enter the population; Emigration of new genes to a new location; New phenotypes in new generations
^1674336733315

Gene variability refers to the proportion of ---::zygosity; Whole-gene level variation; Ex: 14% of fly pop is hetero while 84% is homo
^1674336733323

Nucleotide variability refers to the ---::molecular variation in DNA; Most variations do not equal change in phenotype (could be mutation within an intron or AA redundancy); One change could be significant however (ex SCA)
^1674336733330

Nonheritable variation::Acquired traits cannot be passed; Cannot change phenotype to change genotype (refutes Lamarck's ideas); Ex: body builders do not produce muscular offspring (ability to gain mass could be passed on but not phenotype itself)
^1674336733338

Sources of genetic variation include ---::new (mutant) alleles, neutral variation, gene number/position, rapid reproduction, and sexual reproduction
^1674336733344

New (mutant) alleles can increase genetic variation, but many are ---::detrimental; Heterozygote could protect against detrimental allele (ex hetero advantage and SCA); May become important later for the species
^1674336733351

Neutral variation has no observed ---::affect/advantage; Could be related to non-coding DNA redundancy in codons, or new amino acid still keeps protein functional
^1674336733358

Gene number/position can increase genetic variation if a gene ---::translocates (large translocation usually bad but small could be good depending on environment); May accumulate through time if beneficial; Ex: initially only one olfactory gene in vertebrates but duplicated many times
^1674336733365

Rapid reproduction can increase genetic variation, especially in ---::prokaryotes and viruses (able to reproduce very rapidly compared to eukaryotes); Quick generation time increases likelihood of mutations (Ex: HIV resistance)
^1674336733374

Eukaryotic organisms have low ---::mutation rates compared to prokaryotes (1 in 100,000 genes per generation); Means that DNA replication is working; ON an individual level, this is good for eukaryotes
^1674336733383

Sexual Reproduction is a source of genetic variation due to ---::shuffling of alleles, crossing over in P1, independent assortment in M1, and random fertilization (Ndad + Nmom = 2Nz)
^1674336733390

Microevolution is --- evolution that affects populations (not individuals)::"small scale"; Genes + Env = Expressed Traits; Change in allele frequency in pop through time
^1674336733397

We can track the alleles and genotypes in the ---::gene pool (all the alleles in a population) using the equation p + q = 1.0; Phenotypes inform genotypes and vise versa
^1674336733404

p + q = 1.0::Frequency of dominant allele (p) plus frequency of recessive allele (q) should equal one (the entire gene pool)
^1674336733411

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium::p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.0 (genotype frequencies from allelic frequencies; pheno frequencies can be derived from that); p2 = homo dom frequency; 2pq = hetero frequency; q2 = homo rec frequency
^1674336733418

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium only follows ---::Mendelian inheritance in a non-evolving, random mating, and large, sexually-reproducing population 
^1674336733425

The HWE is only true if ---::no mutations, no migration, large gene pool, random mating, no selection; In realistic terms, the pop is likely evolving and these conditions are not true; Serves as an initial test of evolution on the population
^1674336733433

Ex of HWE::Representative subsample = 25 moths (50 alleles); p (dom alleles) = 10 & q (rec alleles) = 40 so p = 0.20 and q = 0.80 (0.20 + 0.80 - 1.0); HWE = (0.20)^2 + 2(0.20)(0.80) + (0.80)^2 = 1.0 (p2 = 0.04, pq = 0.32, q = 0.64); Most of pop is light-colored so favored selection for light colored moths
^1674336733439

[[2023-01-24]]
Pepper moths cling to tree trunks, and prior to the industrial revolution, the trees were ---::white; Birds readily consumed dark moths (light (dd) was better for camo); Post industrial revolution - moths alleles changed from 1800s into late 1900s as burning coal put soot on trees (dark became desirable); Then industry regulations limited soot so moths avg eventually became light again
^1674594131891

Genetic Drift::Change in alleles by chance through random events; Changes not linked w/ evolution and occurs regardless of genotype or phenotype (so great an event that changes occur indiscriminately)
^1674594131901

Ex of genetic drift::Population could end up w/ more brown rabbits bc they were farther away from volcano than black rabbits
^1674594131908

Founder effect::When a few individuals leave populations to another area; Could be difficult to get population started in new area; Once reproduction does occur, an established population may develop; Limited gene pool initially (adaptability is restricted by small gene pool)
^1674594131914

When a few individuals leave the populations, they often carry over ---::recessive traits; Founder effect; Could be detrimental, but so little genetic variation that population is susceptible to maladaptive traits; homozygosity and inbreeding
^1674594131920

Genetic bottleneck::Refers to small fragmented populations; Populations could be isolated by something as seemingly insignificant as a road; Limited genetic diversity (gene pool and adaptability is restricted; homozygosity and inbreeding)
^1674594131926

Consequences of Genetic Drift::Significant in small populations but observed in all populations; Goes against HW principle assumption bc allelic frequency may change at random (yr-to-yr variation does not indicate evolution); Loss of genetic variation within pop (habitat fragmentation, less resistant to env change); Harmful alleles may become fixed (compound to bottleneck effect)
^1674594131932

Gene Flow::The transfer of alleles either into or out of a population (exchange from an external source); Ex: solid snakes mostly found on islands while banded mostly on mainland (solid blends in w/ rocks, banded blends in w/ mainland), some mainland snakes migrate to island every yr so banded alleles stay in island pop
^1674594131939

Natural Selection::Random variation & non-random selection; Genes already in pop then pressure selects; Genetically fit individuals more likely to contribute genes
^1674594131946

Survival of the fittest::Natural selection; Individuals w/ best genes have advantage and more likely to propagate favorable genes
^1674594131952

Absolute fitness::Refers to the avg individual contribution to the gene pool
^1674594131958

Relative fitness::Refers to a specific individual's contribution to the gene pool relative to the avg of all individuals
^1674594131963

Types of Natural Selection::Sometimes seen and sometimes unseen (SCA vs fur color; Directional selection; Disruptive selection; Stabilizing selection
^1674594131968

Directional selection::When a pop is being pushed into one phenotype; Extreme phenotype is favored; Ex:  Ex: pop turns from brown fur to black; bacterial resistance to antibiotics
^1674594131974

Disruptive selection::When a pop is pressured into two phenotypes; Two extremes favored over intermediate; Ex: british land snails are either light colored (favored in low veg) or dark colored (favored in forest)
^1674594131979

Stabilizing selection::When a pop is favored towards the middle (or average); Intermediate form is selected; Ex: clutch size in birds (too few -> not enough offspring but too many -> not enough nutrients so intermediate is sweet spot); Reduces phenotype variability
^1674594131986

Sexual Selection::Adaptive changes to males and females; Male -> increased ability to compete; Female -> preferential selection to compete 
^1674594131993

Sexual dimorphism::Distinct differences between sex; Clear male and female; Caused by sexual selection; Size and color are the most common forms 
^1674594131998

Intrasexual selection::When individuals within the sex compete; Males patrol/protect territory; Psychological effect to prevent physical (ex puffing up chest to scare off rival; better as species bc not killing off); Physical ex: male elephant seals fight
^1674594132005

Intersexual selection::Mate choice is noticeable; Individuals choose members of the opposite sex w/ better genes; Ex: colorful bird mating displays to attract females
^1674594132010

[[2023-01-26]]
Balancing Selection::Maintenance of undesirable alleles in a population; May see a detrimental trait that remains in a species; Ex: SCA and the hetero advantage
^1674770471108

Frequency-dependent changes are based on the ---::frequency of the phenotype; Ex: left vs right mouthed cichlids - prey species defend against the majority; left scale remover vs right scale remover attack; natural fluctuation occurs as frequency swings back and forth
^1674770471117

Heterozygote advantage::When the hetero has better fitness than the homos; Defined by the genotype (effect depends on pheno of hetero and intermediate form yields stabilizing)
^1674770471123

Selection acts upon existing ---::variation; Evolution does not create genes, it selects for or against them; Ex: mismatched fur colors of hares caused by climate change and snowfall
^1674770471130

Evolution is limited by --- constraints::historical; Previous structures are changed incrementally via selection; Ex: wings derived from similar endoskeleton bones
^1674770471138

Adaptions are often ---::compromises; One trait is best adapted for the env; Same trait is limited or maladapted for another; Ex: seal flippers in water vs on land
^1674770471145

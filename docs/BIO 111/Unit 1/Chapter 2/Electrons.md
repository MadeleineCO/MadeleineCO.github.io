I. Properties
	A. Negative charge
	A. Negatively charged particles located in orbitals
	B. Neutral [[Atoms]] have same number of electrons and protons
	C. Ions
		- Unbalanced charged particles
		- Cation = more protons than electrons
			a. Net positive charge
			b. Atomic number > electron count
		- Anion = fewer protons than electrons
			a. Net negative charge
			b. Atomic number < electron count
	D. Electron arrangement
		- Key to the chemical behavior of an atom lies in the number and arrangement of its electrons in their orbitals
		- Bohr model
			a. Like solar system
				i. Sun is nucleus with electrons in discrete orbits
			b. Reality = Not in a same path like in solar system or bohr model
		- Modern physics defines orbital as area around a nucleus where an electron is most likely to be found
			a. No orbital can contain more than two electrons
		- Electrons have certain amount of energy because they are moving
			a. Faster they move = more energy
			b. Orbitals arranged 3d around nucleus
				- s subshells are shaped like spheres
					~ Each sphere is a single orbital
				- 1ns = closest orbital; spherical
				- 2ns = 2nd closest orbital; spherical but larger than 1n
				- p subshells are made up of three dumbbell-shaped orbitals
				- 2np = principle shell 2n has a p subshell (shell 1 does not)
			c. Energy levels
				- Electrons have potential energy related to their position
				- The farther away an electron is, the more energy it has
					a. Needs more energy to "hold on"
					b. Energy is released if they come closer and gain energy if they go farther away
				- Do NOT confuse energy levels, which are drawn as rings to indicate an electron's *energy*, with orbitals, which have a variety of 3d shapes and indicate an electron's most likely *location*
				- Electrons collide with other electrons and dislodge them
	E. [[Element]]
	F. [[Chemical Bonds]]

1. [[Sheep (Ovine)]]
	- Diameter of wool fiber (17-40 microns)
		1. Fine wool = smaller diameter
		2. Human hair is 40-300 microns
			- Extremally small compared to humans
	- 150-250 lbs.
		1. Not large compared to meat breeds
	- Midwest and West
		1. Too humid in the South
			- Can handle heat, but humidity is devastating 
		2. Many parasites in hot + humid environments like the South
	- Can be eaten, but not as prosperous/nice
	- Bred to not have pigmentation in wool (sorta translucent)
		1. Can be easily dyed 
	- Navaho-Churro
	- Rambouillet
		1. French breed
		2. Moderate size
	- Romney
		1. English breed
		2. Very long wool
2. Wool Fiber
	- Cuticle
		1. Like overlapping scales of a snake
		2. Outside cover w/ barbs and scale-like projections
		3. Can weave fiber together bc the barbs interlock
			- Felting = Process of weaving fibers together
	- Cortex
		1. Internal area w/ spongy material
		2. Spongy and semi hollow
		3. Absorbs dyes easily
		4. Great insulation
			- Trapping warm air 
	- Regular hair is just strands of protein smashed together
		1. Smooth on outside
		2. Does not dye easily and does not hold together well
	- Corse wool
		1. Larger diameter
		2. Bigger barbs on cuticle so not as nice to wear
			- Itchy 
		3. Carpets 
			- Carpet burn - sratchy
	- Fine wool
		1. Smaller diameter
		2. Smaller barbs so more comfortable
	- Silk
		1. No barbs 
		2. Very hard to hold together
		3. Silkworms are one of very few domesticated insects
		4. Smaller than fine wool
	- Cotton
		1. Can be weaved easily cause of edges
3. Quality of wool
	- Fiber diameter
		1. Smaller more favorable
		2. The larger the diameter, the less we use it for
		3. 1/2 blood, 3/8 blood, 1/4 blood, low 1/4 blood, common/braid
			- More good wool sheep blood = smaller diameter and better quality
		4. CPI = Crimps per inch
			- Waves of wool fiber
			- The more waves, the better
				1. More waves in finer wool
			- Higher CPI is better quality
			- More crimps also makes it stretchy
	- Staple length = Longer fibers are better
		1. Generally course tends to be longer but fewer strands, whereas fine wool produces more overall because more fiber strands
		2. Break points = Weakness in fiber due to a past illness 
			- When animal gets sick, nutrients go from growth to helping animal, but wool keeps growing
				1. Results in a weak, break point
				2. Shortens the staple length bc it breaks easily
	- Color of wool
		1. We want white/translucent to make it absorb dye better\
4. Shearing = Removal of the wool
	- Wool is prime over the winter and starts to shed in the spring
	- We shed in the late spring
		1. After the typical frost
		2. Before lambing bc its cleaner and prevents lambs from getting tongue stuck in the wool
	- Fast procedure - can take about 5 min
	- Shearers start in south and move north as spring creeps upward
	- Not an easy job
5. Steps in wool production
	- Raw wool 
		1. Has lanolin (oil)
	- Set of cards make fibers go same direction then spinning frame wraps them together
	- Looms weave to create fabric

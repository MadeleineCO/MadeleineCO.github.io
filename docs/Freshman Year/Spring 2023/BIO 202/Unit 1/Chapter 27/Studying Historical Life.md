1. Paleontology = The study of the fossil record
	1. Make inferences about life, climate, and env
		1. Date and identify life
	2. Cuvier was the Father of Paleontology
	3. Sedimentation = The gradual settling of particles
		1. Sediment deposited by rivers
		2. Strata = Layers of sediment
		3. Organisms trapped in sediment
			4. Can become fossilized over time
				1. Must be covered and undisturbed for millions of years
		4. Law of Superimposition
			1. Bottom layers of strata -> older
			2. Top layers -> younger
			3. Geologic activity influences this
2. Geologic Time

				3. Caused by cyanobacteria
			5. Unicellular eukaryotes arise
				1. Proterozoic (1.8 bya)
					1. Eukaryotic cells arise
				2. Theory of Endosymbiosis
					1. Endosymbiosis = close interaction between two organisms where one envelops another but does not consume it - forms symbiotic relationship
					2. Precursor eukaryotic cell envelops aerobic bacteria
						1. Aerobic bacteria incorporated and becomes mitochondria
					3. Precursor eukaryotic cell envelops cyanobacteria 
						1. Gains chloroplasts 
				3. Theory of Serial Endosymbiosis
					1. Mitochondria came first and followed by plastids
				4. Endosymbiotic theory support
					1. Membrane enzymes similar to prokaryotes
					2. Mitochondria and chloroplasts self-replicate like prokaryotes
					3. Both organelles w/ circular DNA
					4. Transcribe their own DNA like prokaryotes
					5. Mitochondria ribosomes closer to prokaryotes
			6. Origin of multicellularity
				1. Proterozoic (1.3 bya)
					1. First truly multicellular organisms arise
				2. Sexual reproduction (1.2 bya)
					1. Prior to sexual reproduction, binary fission and asexual reproduction
						1. Less genetic diversity and less material for natural selection to work on 
				3. Protist diversification (1.0 bya)
			7. Ediacaran biota

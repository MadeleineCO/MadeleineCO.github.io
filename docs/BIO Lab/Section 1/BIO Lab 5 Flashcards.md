Enzymes are special ---::proteins that lower activation energy; Act as catalysts to speed up reactions
^1663895709937

Lock and key::Enzymes are specific to certain things
^1663895709947

pH and Temperature::Too acidic or too basic can denature enzymes; Too cold or too hot can denature them as well
^1663895709954

Denaturing enzymes::Causes proteins to come apart if not suitable to environment; If you change shape, you change (or prevent) function
^1663895709961

The reaction:: 2 H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) --> 2 H2O + O2 (water and oxygen); Enzyme catalyst is peroxidase (from turnips)
^1663895709968

Guaiacol::Color-changing indicator that is not essential to reaction; Allows us to see formation of products and becomes darker as enzymatic reaction progresses
^1663895709975

Catabolic reaction::Breaking down reactants; Hydrogen peroxide broken down into two separate products (water and oxygen)
^1663895709981

The experiments::Baseline peroxidase enzyme reaction (no change on pH or temp); Effect of pH on peroxidase activity (Testing levels 3-8)
^1663895709988

Effect of temperature on peroxidase activity::Ice, 25*/room temp, 35*, 45*, 60* Centigrade
^1663895709995

pH time 5 results::3 = no enzyme activity, 4 = activity 5, 5 = activity 5, 6 = activity 5, 7 = activity 5, 8 = activity 1
^1664110690389

Temperature time 5 results::Ice = activity 5, 25* = activity 5, 35* = activity 5, 45* = activity 5, 60* = activity 5

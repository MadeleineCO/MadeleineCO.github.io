1. Nutrients: Components of the diet required for normal physiological function
	1. Nutrient Requirements
		- Water
			- Transportation
				1. Moves nutrients to where they need to go
				2. Moves red blood cells, etc.
			- Temperature regulation
		- Energy
		- Protein
		- Vitamins
		- Minerals
	2. Common Features
		- Prehension: Method to gather or collect nutrients to enter the digestive system
			- Hands/silverware for humans
			- [[Horse (Equine)]] uses upper lip to collect and push to teeth
			- [[Sheep (Ovine)]]  grabs with teeth
			- Starfish use stomach to grab and engulf food
		- Mastication: Mechanical digestion
			- Chewing with teeth for humans
		- Digestion
			- Chemical
				1. We release compounds to break food down
				2. Enzymes, bile, etc.
			- Microbial
				1. Cows, sheep, horses cannot digest grass, but the microbes inside of them can ([[Herbivores]] and [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]])
				2. Symbiotic relationship
			- Some species do both chemical and microbial, whereas others (such as us) mostly do one
		- Absorption: Transfer of nutrients from the digestive track to the circulatory system 
		- Elimination
			- Can be non-digestible
				1. When the body has not digested all of the nutrients available in the item
					~ Not all nutrients used effectively (inefficiency)
			- Or can be indigestible
				1. Cannot digest it at all (ex: rock)
2. Classes of animals based on what they eat
	1. [[Carnivores]]
	2. [[Omnivores]]
	3. [[Herbivores]]
	4. Some Subgroups
		- Ex: Insectivore, Frugivore, Granivore
3. Primary types of digestive systems
	1. [[Monogastric]]
		- [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]]
	2. [[Ruminant]]
	3. [[Avian]]/Modified [[Monogastric]]

1. Equine selection is the least studied of livestock because. . .
	1. Other animals are raised for food purposes while horses are used for recreation
	2. Long Gi
		1. Much longer compared to other spp
		2. Long Gi = slow rate of change for selection 
	3. Long gestation
		4. About eleven months
	4. Long age to puberty
		1. 3-4 years
	5. Only one offspring/year
	6. Lack of accurate records
		1. Difficult to drive genetic change w/ lack of info
2. Problems determining h^2 in horses
	1. Tremendous environmental variation
		1. Racing
			1. Track surface 
			2. Condition
			3. Age
			4. Level of training
				1. Even if genetically endowed, if poor trainer, animal will not perform
			5. Nutrition
				1. No standard according to age, physiological condition, etc.
		2. h^2 = vg / vp = as vp (env variation) changes, h^2 is affected
			1. Vp = Vg + Ne
	2. Data bias
		1. Not all contemporaries allowed same opportunities (performance)
		2. Selection of animals based on likelihood to excel
	3. Limited info available is probably higher than reality
		1. We always analyze the best animals
3. Traits of Economic Importance
	1. Two categories 
		1. Fertility 
			1. h^2 = 0.05
				1. Very low heritability
				2. h^2 of fertility probably higher than reported due to man's influence
			2. Avg live foal crop estimate = 50%-70%
				1. Refers to percentage of foals that will be born live (not a lost pregnancy/stillborn/death shortly after birth)
				2. No other livestock w/ such a low number
					1. Lower performance compared to other livestock spp
			3. Duration of estrus/time of ovulation
				1. From a management perspective, must know when to breed
					1. Estrus duration = 5-7 days
					2. Ovulation occurs around 24hr before end of heat
						1. Must breed at the end of heat
			4. Artificial birth date = January 1st
				1. Must be born within the year to compete w/ age group but the earlier, the better for more training time
				2. But horses are long-day breeders 
			5. Hand mating/pasture mating/AI
				1. Pasture mating = most natural 
				2. Hand mating = selecting stallion and mare and putting them together
					1. Under human supervision
				3. AI = most direct
			6. Fertility is an issue in horses
				1. Little improvement in repro by selection alone
				2. Changes in env more successful
					1. Nutrition
					2. Health care
					3. Breeding seasons
		2. Athletic performance
			1. Racing (thoroughbreds) 
				1. Anatomical and physiological basis
				2. Stride length
				3. Stride frequency
				4. Muscle fiber type
					1. Slow twitch --- 
					2. ---
				5. h^2 = 0.35 for racing ability in thoroughbreds
					1. Great variation
					2. Limited contemporary measuring may limit h^2
			2. Some degree of h^2 based on skeletal structure
				1. See chart on slideshow ---
				2. Not reliable measures of h^2
				3. We assume high h^2 for traits
					1. Sales of horses based on pedigree
				4. Many methods to measure h^2
					1. Speed index - AQHA
					2. Lifetime earnings ---
					3. ---
			3. No significant improvement in speed index base in last 60 years
			4. Trotters and Pacers
				1. Trotters = dominant
				2. Pacers = recessive
				3. Difficult to teach trotters to pace
				4. h^2 = 0.10 - 0.25
					1. Low to moderate
			5. Cattle work (various functions)
				1. Ranch work
					1. Horses work livestock over rough terrain
				2. Roping 
					1. Involves close contact w/ animals and high agility
				3. Cutting
					1. Highly athletic
					2. Horse must respond to calf movement after ---
					3. ---
					4. High degree of training required
					5. Limited num of horses within line to have opportunity to compete
					6. h^2 is about 0.15 (low)
						1. Elite horses 
			6. Cow sense
				1. When horse appears to have great interest in cattle
				2. Difficult to research h^2 of cow sense
				3. Involved w/ cutting
			7. Barrel racing 
				1. Speed and agility required
				2. ---
			8. Jumping ability
				1. Various studies that estimate free jumping h^2 = 0.24 - 0.56
					1. W/ rider h^2 = ---
				2. ---
4. History of Selection
	1. Development of distinct breeds and types of horses in last few thousand years
	2. Manufactured "registered" breeds
		1. Color breeds are not purebreds
			1. Ex: Palominos don't breed true
	3. Genetic Relationship to Offspring 
		1. See table on slideshow
	4. Mating Systems
		1. Linebreeding
			1. Very common
			2. Form of inbreeding 
			3. Concentrates genes from one individual
		2. Positive assortative mating
			1. Breed best to best based on sire performance
				1. Major selection criteria
			2. Increases heterozygosity
		3. Inbreeding
			1. Only used when trying to start a new breed
		4. Crossbreeding
			1. Used somewhat in breed development
			2. Warmbloods 
				1. Coldblood x Hotblood
			3. ---
		5. ---
	5. Selection Against Detrimental
		1. *CID* (Combined Immunodeficiency)
			1. Seen in Arabians 
			2. Recessive
			3. See [[Selection]]
			4. AKA SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)
			5. Immune system is compromised so that after passive immunity from mother weans off, the immune system does not kick in 
				1. Foals die from infection
			6. Defect in DNA-PKcs
				1. DNA Dependent Protein Kinase catalytic subunit
			7. Mode of inheritance = Autosomal recessive
			8. All animals should be tested to avoid mating heterozygotes 
		2. Bleeders 
			1. Exercise Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage
			2. Causes bursting of blood vessels in lungs
			3. Residual damage due to ---
			4. Increased pulmonary pressure
			5. Excessive pounding of hooves results in lung trauma
			6. Lasix - diuretic
				1. Increased urination 
				2. Removes water 
			7. Adversely affects performance
			8. Negative public perception 
			9. Mode of inheritance = autosomal recessive
		3. OCD or DOD (osteochondritis dissecans & developmental orthopedic disease)
			1. Skeletal disorder
			2. Disturbance of endochondral ossification
				1. Softening of bones (---?)
			3. Autosomal recessive
		4. Wobblers Syndrome
			1. AKA CVM (cervical vertebral malformation)
			2. Thoroughbreds and quarter horses
			3. Malformation of cervical vertebrae (especially 5th, 6th, and 7th)
			4. Varying degrees of spinal cord compression and different levels of ataxia
				1. Ataxia = wobbly gait
			5. Autosomal recessive
		5. HYPP (hyperkalemic periodic paralysis)
			1. Autosomal *dominant*
				1. Only need one parent as a carrier
			2. First seen in a line of quartertones called impressive
			3. Defect in voltage-gated sodium channels of muscle cells
				1. Causes high level of K+ in blood
				2. Sometimes the animals just freeze
			4. Incomplete penetrance
				1. More complication
				2. Parent may not express it 
		6. Lethal White Foal Syndrome
			1. Overo x Overo = white foal
			2. Autosomal recessive
			3. Aganglionosis = when large intestine lacks nerve cells and therefore cannot function
				1. Colic occurs 
				2. Waste is stuck
				3. Foal dies if no immediate intermission (early death)
			4. Mutation in Endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) gene
		7. H.C./HERDA (hyperelastosis cutis)
			1. Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia
			2. First found in quarterhorse called Poco Bueno
			3. Lack of adhesion of outer skin w/ dermis 
				1. Collagen defect
					1. Collagen serves as kind of glue to hold skin together
			4. Usually appears at 2 years when horse is first being broke to saddle 
			5. In horses w/ HC, the "glue is inferior" so skin layers separate
			6. Autosomal recessive 
			7. ---

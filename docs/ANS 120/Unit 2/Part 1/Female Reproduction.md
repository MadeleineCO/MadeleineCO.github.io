1. Importance
	1. Just a 3% improvement in reproductive rate would greatly increase num of animals and consequently production
	2. Increase in productivity and efficiency lowers cost
	3. Alter reproduction
		- Sometimes want to increase reproduction (ex endangered species)
		- Sometimes want to limit reproduction (feral cats)
		- Much easier to mess up reproduction than improve it
2. Terms
	1. Estrous Cycle = All physiological and behavioral changes from one ovulation to the next consecutive ovulation ([[Female Reproduction]])
		- Menstrual Cycle in humans and primates is very different
	2. Estrus = Period of receptivity to be bred by the male
	3. Ovum = Female gamete
	4. Follicle = Involves the ovum and all the cells that support ovum development in an ovary
	5. Ovulation = Release of the ovum from the follicle
		- The follicle ruptures and the ovum is released away from the ovary
	6. Gestation = The process of prenatal development of an organism in the uterus
		- Chicken egg development does not occur in uterus, so never a fetus, always an embryo (incubation, not gestation)
	7. Parturition = The birth process
	8. Oviposition = The process of laying an egg (usually [[avian|avians]])
	9. Incubation = Embryonic development outside the body (usually [[avian|avians]])
	10. See chart for [[Animal-Specific Reproductive Info.png]]!
	11. Duplex = Two cervixes (Marsupials and rodents)
	12. Bicornate = Poorly to moderately developed uterine horns in mares and cows but highly developed in bitches, queens, and sows
		- Livestock, cats, dogs
		- Two ovaries, two oviducts, a single cervix, uterine horns, uterine body, vagina 
			- [[Female Reproductive Structures]]
			- Estrous cycle
				1. If a cow's cycle is 210 days, First the follicle grows and produces estrogen until it peaks and ovulation occurs (which breaks the follicle). Then, the corpus luteum grows and produces P4. If animal not pregnant, the corpus luteum and P4 goes away, follicle starts regrowing, and cycle restarts.
					1. Cows have multiple follicles, but only one ends up ovulation. "Follicle wars"
	13. Simplex = no cervix
		- Humans, primates
3. [[Estrus Cycle and Parturition Process]]
4. [[Avian]] Reproduction ([[Female Reproductive Structures]])
	- 1 left ovary
		1. Contains yolk with ovum 
			- Yolk has energy, minerals, vitamins, and some protein
			- Color of yolk depends on diet
	- 1 modified left oviduct
		1. Infundibulum = funnel
			- Captures ovum and if breeding has occurred, fertilization occurs there
		2. Magnum = Albumen is added 
			- Albumen is the primary protein
			- Some structural proteins/support structure
		3. Isthmus = Inner and outer shell membrane
	- Uterus/Shell gland = Shell formation
		1. Shell is made up of calcium carbonate (highly polar salts)
		2. Some shells have pigments from pigment producing cells
	- Cloaca = common opening
	- Egg
		1. Shell, shell membrane (inner and outer), Chalaza attached to yolk, ---
		2. Incubation NOT gestation
			- Utilized packaged resources 
		3. Chicks don't need to eat or drink for about three days because yolk ruminants

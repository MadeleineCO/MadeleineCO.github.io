1. Structures
	1. Nasal cavity + Nostrils -> Pharynx (glottis and larynx nearby) -> Trachea -> Lungs + Bronchi (diaphragm underneath)
		1. See graphic 
		2. Glottis (which is covered by the epiglottis) prevents food from going into lungs 
	2. ![[Pasted image 20230412111303.png]]
	3. Smooth muscles lines the bronchi so that they can expand/contract involuntarily
2. Conduction Structures
	1. Move air (do not exchange gasses)
	2. Nose -> Pharynx -> Larynx & Trachea -> Bronchi -> Bronchioles
	3. Additional Roles
		1. Filter air (cilia & mucus)
		2. Warm air 
		3. Communication (larynx and the voice box)
	4. ![[Pasted image 20230412111553.png]]
3. Exchange Structures
	1. High surface area 
		1. Gas exchange center
	2. Aveoli 
		1. 300 million w/ about 80m^2 of surface area
	3. d = 0.5 - 1.5 um
		1. About two cells thick
		2. Thin layer minimizes diffusion rate
	4. Very sensitive
	5. ![[Pasted image 20230412111807.png]]
		1. Red = oxygenized blood
		2. Blue = deoxygenized blood
		3. Purple = gas exchange
	6. Inhalation Process
		1. External Intercostal and Diaphragm *contract*
		2. Thoracic volume increases and pressure decreases
			1. Creates *negative pressure*
		3. Air passes into lung due to pressure diff
		4. Thorax and lungs -> Elastic tension
	7. Exhalation Process
		1. External intercostal and diaphragm *relax*
		2. Elastic tension is released
		3. Volume decreases and pressure increases
		4. Non-forced exhalation although abdominal muscles can forcibly contract to produce greater exhalation
4. Mammalian Ventilation
	1. Tidal volume
		1. 500 mL (average at rest)
	2. Anatomical dead space
		1. Trachea and bronchi
		2. 150 mL
	3. Breathing rate
		1. Driven by PCO2, not PO2
		2. Hypoventilation = Increase in PCO2
		3. Hyperventilation = Decrease in PCO2
	4. Respiratory control center (RCC) in the brain
		1. Ex: holding breath (negative feedback loop)
			1. Blood PCO2 increases
			2. Blood PO2 decreases
			3. Blood H2CO3 increases
			4. Blood pH (level of H+ ions) decreases
			5. Chemoreceptors stimulated by these changes
			6. Sends impulse to RCC
			7. RCC sends impulse to EI (---) & Diaphragm 
			8. Involuntary inhalation occurs 
	5. Respiratory Pigments 
		1. Binding Affinity (BA) = Ability to hold O2
			1. P50 = 50% saturation of pigments 
				1. Two distinct curves f- one for hemoglobin and one for myoglobin
		2. Factors Affecting BA
			1. Pigment type
			2. Temp
			3. pH
			4. CO2
			5. Loading vs Unloading
				1. At areas where we want O2 to be unloaded, we change conditions so that BA goes down
				2. When we increase pH, the amount of O2 able to be held increases
				3. High temps = less O2 capacity
		3. Hemoglobin (Hgl)
			1. Red blood cells
			2. 4 heme groups
			3. 4 Fe atoms
			4. *Oxyhemoglobin* = has O2 
			5. *Deoxyhemoglobin* = no O2
			6. Once you bind one O2, Hgl changes conformation and encourages the second to bind
				1. As second and third binds, affinity increases more until the fourth is bound 
		4. Myoglobin
			1. Muscle cells
			2. One Fe atom
			3. High binding affinity
			4. Especially important for marine mammals 
				1. Whales collapse lungs so that it can sink (affects buoyancy)
					1. Can do this for about two hours 
5. Blood Oxygen
	1. Need disparity between fluids so that gas exchange can occur passively 
		1. Partial pressure difference promotes passive diffusion of gasses 
	3. Venous Blood
		1. PO2 = 40 mmHg
		2. PCO2 = 46 mmHg
	4. Alveolar gas
		1. PO2 = 105 mmHg
			1. Promotes movement of O2 from alveoli (in lungs) to blood (105 mmHg vs 40 mmHg)
		2. PCO2 = 40 mmHg
			1. Partial pressure difference = CO2 wants to move out of blood into the alveoli (46 mmHg vs 40 mmHg)
		2.  1 atm = 160 mmHg at sea level 
			1. 0.5 atm = 80 mmHg 
			2. 0.25 atm = 40 mmHg
			3. High altitudes affect this system
	5. Arterial Blood
		1. PO2 = 100 mmHg
		2. PCO2 = 40 mmHg
6. Transport of CO2
	1. See graphic
		1. ---
		2. Remember %s
	2. CO2 binds to proteins in Hgl
		1. Conformation change decreases affinity to O2
		2. Carbonic anhydrase (CA)
			1. Converts CO2 -> H2CO3
			2. Removes CO2 from the plasma
		3. Buffering system
			1. Can favor release of CO2 out of lungs

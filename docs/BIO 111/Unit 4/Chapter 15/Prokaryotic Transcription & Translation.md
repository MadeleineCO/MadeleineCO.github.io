1. [[Genes and Proteins]]
2. [[Prokaryotic Cell]]
3. Transcription requires. . .
	- Promoter
		1. Forms a recognition and binding site for RNA polymerase
		2. Found upstream of the start site
		3. Not transcribed
		4. Asymmetrical 
			- Indicate site of initiation and direction off transcription
	- Start site
		1. How do you find correct position?
		2. Certain signals indicates starting point
		3. Upstream of transcription start site is a region of Ts and As (known as tatabox)
			- Proteins known as sigma factors can identify tataboxes
			- The sigma subunit of prokaryotic RNAO polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight. The sigma subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription is complete.
	- Elongation process
		1. Grows in the 5'-3' direction as ribonucleotides are added
		2. Transcription bubble = contains RNA polymerase, [[DNA]] template, and growing RNA transcript
		3. After transcription bubble passes, the now transcribed [[DNA]] is rewound as it leaves the bubble
	- Termination site
		1. Marked by sequence that signals "stop" to polymerase
			- Causes the formation of phosphodiester bonds to cease
			- RNA-[[DNA]] hybrid within the transcription bubble
			- RNA polymerase releases the [[DNA]]
			- [[DNA]] winds
		2. Hairpin loops caused by binding of RNA can force termination
	- The promote, start site, and termination site forms a transcription unit
	- Makes RNA version of coding strand from template strand
4. Prokaryotic transcription is coupled to translation
	- mRNA begins to be translated before transcription is finished
	- The front end of a [[protein]] is called *N terminal* and back end is called *C terminal* 
		1. The front end of RNA is *5'* and back end is *3'*
	- As soon as front end has been made after starting transcription, translation can start to occur as ribosomes bind and bacteria can make [[protein]] before RNA is fully synthesized 
		1. Can code for multiple proteins on one mRNA
			- If there is one mRNA w/ multiple genes, it is called an *operon*
				1. Operons are unique to prokaryotes
				2. Grouping of functionally related genes
				3. Multiple [[enzymes]] for a pathway
				4. Can be regulated together

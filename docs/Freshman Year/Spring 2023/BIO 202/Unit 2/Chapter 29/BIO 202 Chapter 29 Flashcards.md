Mammary glands::First form of parents suppling nutrition to young (egg creatures get nutrition from yolk); High in sugars and lipids; Hepls establish immune system in young; Suckling stimulates prolactin, stimulating more milk production (positive feedback loop); Fewer young and more parental care
^1677642893529

Birds and mammals are both ---::endothermic; Maintain steady temp within a range (hypo- or hyperthermic when outside of range); Can capture metabolic heat and use for body temp regulation (greater efficiency)
^1677642893534

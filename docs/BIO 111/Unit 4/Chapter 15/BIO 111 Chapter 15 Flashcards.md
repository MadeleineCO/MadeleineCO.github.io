Euchromatin (bio)::Loosely packed and transcriptionally; DNA form during interphase (replication occurs in S phase and DNA polymerase is enzyme that must be present in this phase)
^1668652005532

Heterochromatin (bio)::Tightly packed and transcriptionally silent; DNA form during mitosis
^1668690240317

Chromatin is made up of ---::genetic material and histone proteins
^1668690240328

Central Dogma::First described by Francis Crick - the direction that DNA  flows; Info only goes from DNA --> RNA --> protein
^1668690240335

Transcription::DNA --> mRNA; DNA-directed synthesis of RNA; Only template strand of DNA is used; U (uracil) in RNA corresponds to T (thymine) in DNA
^1668690240342

Translation::RNA --> protein; mRNA used to direct synthesis of polypeptides; Takes place in ribosome; Requires several kinds of RNA
^1668690240350

Retroviruses violate the flow of ---::info by using enzyme reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome info DNA; You can take mRNA and convert it back into DNA (useful for research bc RNA degrades more quickly than DNA)
^1668690240357

Instructions on DNA are transcribed onto mRNA. Ribosomes are able to read the ---::genetic information inscribed on a strand of mRNA and use this information to string amino acids together into a protein.
^1668690240365

In RNA transcription, only a tine piece of DNA ---::opens up (no replication forks); Called *transcription bubble*
^1668690240372

Coding strand::Strand that has genetic info for building protein; Other DNA strand is the *template strand* (RNA polymerase reads this to make RNA copy of code w/ corresponding nucleotide bases)
^1668690240381

RNA polymerase::Reads the template strand to make RNA copy of code w/ corresponding nucleotide bases; If template strand of DNA is TACG, then RNA becomes AUGC
^1668690240388

Once you transcribe mRNA, you have to ---::process it; When its processed, it's recognized as ready to be shipped outside nucleus and used
^1668690240395

After processing, mRNA is ---::used in ribosomes to make proteins (translation)
^1668690240402

RNA (bio)::All synthesized from DNA template by transcription; 2 major types (mRNA for transcription, rRNA for ribosomes, tRNA for translation)
^1668690258164

Messenger RNA::Made by transcription from DNA template strand
^1668690240414

Ribosomal RNA::Major component to ribosome; More RNA in a ribosome than there is protein; rRNA is synthesized in the nucleolus
^1668690240421

Transfer RNA (tRNA) (bio)::Like adapter molecule; 20 amino acids and 4 bases, so bases must be read in groups of 3 to get  64 possible combos (synonyms so that 64 combos = 20 amino acids); One one end, has info related to nucleic acid but on other has amino acid attached (translation)
^1668690258174

Other types of RNA::Small nuclear RNA (snRNA), Signal recognition particle RNA, Micro-RNA (miRNA)
^1668690240431

RNA front = --- and back = ---::5'; 3' (same as DNA)

Genetic Code History::Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner determined how the order of nucleotides in DNA encoded amino acid order; Marshall Nirenberg identified the codons that specify each amino acid
^1668707983435

Codon::Block of 3 DNA nucleotides corresponding to an amino acid; Introduced single nucleotide insertions or deletions and looked for mutations; Several codons code for the same amino acid while others don't code for any amino acids
^1668707983448

Stop codons::Three codons used to terminate translation (UUA, UGA, UAG); Do not code for an amino acid
^1668707983456

Start codon::Codon (AUG) used to signify the start of translation; Codes for methionine
^1668707983463

Code is degenerate, meaning that ---::some amino acids are specified by more than one codon; It often doesn't matter what base is in the third position; Third position called *wabble position* if the third base doesn't matter (all codes for same amino acid; ex valine)
^1668707983470

Wabble position::If the third base doesn't matter (the first two bases all code for the same amino acid), then it is called the wabble position (ex valine)
^1668707983477

Code is universal::Mitochondria and chloroplasts have some differences in "stop signals"; Code works for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and practically the same system across all organisms
^1668707983484

Three reading frames::When you read in different frame, you may create different amino acid; Frameshift mutations indicate importance of reading frame
^1668707983492

Frameshift mutations (bio)::The deletion of two nucleotides shifts the reading frame of mRNA and changes the entire protein message, creating a nonfunctional protein or terminating protein synthesis altogether; Changes primary structure (which may impact the tertiary structure which may impact the function)
^1668707997511

To get in the right reading frame, you must know ---::where to begin; This is the importance of the start codon (AUG); AUG codes for *methionine*
^1668707983499

Structures of 20 amino acids found in proteins are composed of ---::amino group (NH3), carboxyl group (COO), and a side chain (could be nonpolar, polar, or charged as well as big or small); The variety of amino acid side chains gives rise to the incredible variation of protein structure and function
^1668707983507

Most of our DNA does not code for ---::proteins (just about 1%); About 6.5 ft of DNA total, so where do you start? How do you find starting point for a specific protein (ex hemoglobin)?
^1668707983514

Transcription requires::promoter (forms recognition and binding site for RNA pol), start site (tatabox w/ sigma factors for prokaryotes and series of TFs for eukaryotes), elongation process (5'-3' direction using RNA pol and transcription bubble), and termination site (stop sequence or hairpin loops)
^1668707983521

The promoter, start site, and termination site form a ---::transcription unit; Transcription makes RNA version of coding strand from template strand
^1668707983528

Prokaryotic start site::How do you find correct position to start?::Certain signals indicate starting point; Upstream of transcription start site is region of Ts and As (called *tatabox*); Proteins known as *sigma factors* identify tataboxes in prokaryotes
^1668707983535

Sigma factors::Identify tataboxes in prokaryotes to start transcription; The sigma subunit of prokaryotic RNAO polymerase recognizes consensus sequences found in the promoter region upstream of the transcription start sight; The sigma subunit dissociates from the polymerase after transcription is complete
^1668707983543

Transcription elongation process::Grows in the 5'-3' direction as ribonucleotides are added; Transcription bubble = contains RNA polymerase, DNA template, and growing RNA transcript; After transcription bubble passes, the now transcribed DNA is rewound as it leaves the bubble
^1668707983550

Termination site::Marked by sequence that signals "stop" to polymerase; Causes the formation of phosphodiester bonds to cease; RNA-DNA hybrid within the transcription bubble, so RNA pol must release the DNA and allow DNA to rewind; Hairpin loops caused by the binding of RNA can force termination
^1668707983557

Prokaryotic transcription is coupled to ---::translation; mRNA begins to be translated before transcription is finished; Front end of protein is called *N terminal* (corresponds to 5' end) and back end is *C terminal* (corresponds to 3' end)
^1668707983565

As soon as the front end of prokaryotic RNA has been created after starting transcription, translation can start to occur as ---::ribosomes bind and bacteria can make protein before RNA is fully synthesized
^1668707983573

Prokaryotes can code for multiple proteins on one ---::mRNA;  If there is one mRNA w/ multiple genes, it is called an *operon* (unique to prokaryotes)
^1668707983580

Operon::Seen in prokaryotes; Grouping of functionally related genes; Multiple enzymes for a pathway can be regulated together; One mRNA w/ multiple genes
^1668707983587

In eukaryotes, there are three different ---::RNA polymerases; RNA pol I transcribes DNA, RNA pol II transcribes mRNA and some snRNA, and RNA pol III transcribes tRNA and some other small RNAs; Each RNA pol recognizes its own promoter
^1668707983595

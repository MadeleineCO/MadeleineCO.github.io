All living organisms are made up of ---, which all need ---::cells; energy; Cellular respiration is the process of getting energy and energy management
^1664385370227

Cellular respiration takes ---::high energy organic molecules and converts them into smaller energy packets (ex glucose --> ATP)
^1664385370242

Cellular respiration money analogy::Like 100$ (high energy) --> 1$ (smaller, low energy packets)
^1664385370248

1st Stage (Glycolysis)::Glucose (C6H12O6) broken down into pyruvate; Produces net 2 ATP; Then goes to either aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration depending on availability of oxygen
^1664385370255

Aerobic respiration (biol)::Occurs when oxygen (O2) is present and much more energy-efficient; Occurs in mitochondria of eukaryotes; Includes Pyruvate Oxidation and Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport System; Creates total of 36 ATP
^1664385394634

Aerobic respiration equation::Glucose + Oxygen --> Water + CO2 + 36 ATP (energy)
^1664385370263

Anaerobic respiration (biol)::Occurs in absence of oxygen, Much less energy-efficient; Produces Ethanol or Lactic Acid
^1664385394645

Prokaryotes, Protists, Fungi, Protists anaerobic respiration equation::Glucose --> Ethanol (2C2H5OH) + CO2 + 2ATP (energy); Fermentation
^1664385370270

Animal anaerobic respiration equation::Glucose --> Lactic acid (2C3H6O3) + 2ATP (energy); Lactic acid production

Our yeast experiment::Feeding yeast (eukaryotic organism) glucose, maltose (instead of sucrose), and starch; Also putting yeast in water as baseline
^1664385370282

Glucose is a ---, maltose is a ---, and starch is a ---::monosaccharide; disaccharide; polysaccharide
^1664385370288

Measuring anaerobic respiration in our experiment::Glucose --> Ethanol + 2CO2 + 2ATP; Testing how it works w/ maltose, and starch as well as glucose; Think about the size of each of these substrates (glucose, maltose, starch); Measuring how much CO2 was produced; CO2 produced is difference between 10 ml and measured amount of yeast solution after reaction
^1664385370296


[[2022-09-30]]
The most CO2 was produced in the --- solution::glucose (small and can be quickly broken down); About 4 ml of CO2
^1664560354856

Barely any CO2 was produced in the --- solution::maltose (breaks down more quickly than starch, but more slowly than glucose); About 1.5 ml of CO2
^1664560354864

No CO2 was produced in the --- solution::starch (large so it takes yeast a much longer time than smaller carbs such as glucose to break down); 0 ml of CO2

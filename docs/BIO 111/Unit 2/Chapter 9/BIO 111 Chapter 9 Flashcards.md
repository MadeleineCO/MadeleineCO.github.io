Communication between cells requires ---::ligand (signaling molecule) and receptor protein (molecule to which receptor binds); Interaction of these components initiates process of signal transduction, which converts info in signal into cellular response
^1664412028590

Ligands could be ---::protein, small molecule, gas, physical connection etc; Different ways to signal
^1664412028603

Four basic communication mechanisms::Direct contact, paracine, endocrine, synaptic
^1664412028609

Direct contact::"Receive the squeeze"; Rapid (instantaneous) but localized
^1664412028615

Paracrine signaling::Nearby cells; Ligand and receptor not touching (ligand is released then binds to the receptor); Can be moderately quick; Inflammation is one type of paracrine signaling
^1664412028621

Endocrine signaling::Ligands travel long distances to get to receptors; Relatively slow but long-lasting and powerful; Sex hormones
^1664412028627

Synaptic signaling::Don't touch, but precise distance between where ligands are released and receptors; Very fast (almost instant) and can span great distances; Travels very quickly for the distances involved; Pain receptors in fingers zip a signal from brain and from brain to fingers, but response is almost instant because of speed
^1664412028633

Some cells send signals to themselves::A fifth type/version of paracrine; Autocrine signaling
^1664412028639

Signal transduction::Events within the cell that occur in response to a signal (ex: when a ligand binds to a receptor protein); Different cell types can respond differently to the same signal
^1664412028647

Epinephrine example of signal transduction::Can bind to different receptors causing unintended side effects; Challenging for pharmaceutical industry
^1664412028654

Synaptic gap::The distance between the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic cell; Very small and allows for rapid diffusion of the neurotransmitters; Enzymes in the synaptic cleft degrade some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal.
^1664412028660

Synaptic signaling is a ---::very specialized form of paracrine signaling across synaptic gaps through neurotransmitters
^1664574050793

Enzymes in the synaptic cleft degrade ---::some types of neurotransmitters to terminate the signal; (ex acetylcholine can make muscles contract so if signal is not turned off, muscle will use all its energy as it keeps firing)
^1664574050804

Neurons::Have long skinny piece called axon, which is connected to the cell body (holds the nucleus) and the axon terminal on the other side; Dendrites surround the cell body and neurotransmitters that emit from the axon terminal can bind to these on another cell
^1664574050811

Signals go one direction across neurons from ---::dendrites down across cell body and axon to the axon terminal
^1664574050817

Neurons cannot ---::divide/reproduce through mitosis (ex paralysis cant heal itself)
^1664574050824

Synaptic receptors can be in --- or non neural cells such as ---::dendrites on neurons; muscles (neuromuscular junctions = when neurons bind via neurotransmitters to muscle cells)
^1664574050830

Synaptic signals can be ---::excitatory or inhibitory; Excitatory and inhibitory signals can both bind on a neuron and have opposite effects
^1664574050836

SSRI drugs::Antidepressants; Sometimes serotonin gets destroyed by enzymes too quickly (leads to depression bc not enough effect) so these drugs slow the breaking down of serotonin
^1664574050842

Receptors can be defined by their ---::location; Intracellular (located within a cell) and intercellular (between several cells)
^1664574050848

Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors) are located ---::on the plasma membrane to bind a ligand outside the cell; Transmembrane protein in contact w/ both cytoplasm and extracellular environment
^1664574050854

Intracellular receptors::Within cells; Common nonpolar, lipid-soluble structure; Can cross plasma membrane (hydrophobic) to bind w/ steroid receptors, causing the receptor (not anchored to membrane) to shift from cytoplasm to binding to nucleus and DNA; Act as regulators of gene expression
^1664574050861

Cortisol::Stress hormone; Cortisone is a drug that helps w/ pain but its hydrophobic so must be given in small quantities as it does not break down in water
^1664574050867

Steroid hormones have similar chemical structures to their ---::precursor, cholesterol; Small and hydrophobic and can diffuse across plasma membrane into cell where they interact w/ internal receptors
^1664574050873

Estradiol and testosterone::Estradiol (estrogen) has hydroxyl group whereas testosterone has just oxygen instead; Cholesterol has hydroxyl group there (as well as a hydrocarbon tail); Different functional groups
^1664574050879

The prefix "di" indicates ---::two hydroxyl groups in hormones 
^1664574050885

Estradiol mirrors cholesterol (both have hydroxyl group) at end, whereas testosterone has ---::just oxygen at that location; Names can be indicators of structure; "ol" = hydroxyl and "one" = oxygen
^1664574050892

Hydrophobic signaling molecules typically diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with ---::intracellular receptors in the cytoplasm
^1664574050898

Transcription factors::Many intracellular receptors interact w/ DNA in the nucleus and regulate gene expression as transcription factors (transcription = DNA --> mRNA); Can turn genes on and off
^1664574050904

Intercellular receptor::Cell surface receptors (membrane receptors) can bind a ligand outside the cell; Transmembrane proteins in contact w/ both cytoplasm and extracellular environment; Photons stimulate plants; Sound waves physically push wavelength-sensitive receptors to stimulate them
^1664574050911

Chemically gated ion channels::Channel-linked receptors that open to let a specific ion pass in response to a ligand; Intercellular
^1664574050917

Cells usually keep sodium outside cells via Na+K+ pump, but they also can ---::open a chemically gated ion channel to let sodium enter; Increases the resting potential of the cell
^1664574050923

Resting potential::The charge inside a cell; Common value is -60 mV; Naturally negative; When sodium enters, resting potential increases (less negative) because the ions are positive; Can depolarize cell towards zero then can hyperpolarize in opposite (positive) direction (called action potential)
^1664574050930

Action potential::When you allow Na+ ions to enter, making cell less negative/more positive, neurons will fire in response to the change in resting potential; After firing, the Na+K+ pump must remove Na+ ions to maintain normal resting potential after action potential
^1664574050936


Enzymatic receptors::Receptor is an enzyme that is activated by the ligand; Almost all are protein kinases; Intercellular
^1664574050942

G protein-coupling receptor (GPCR)::A G-protein (a protein bound to GTP) assists in transmitting the signal from receptor to enzyme (effector); Intercellular
^1664574050948


G-protein::A protein that is bound to GTP (guanine triphosphate); GPCRs use these to transmit signals from receptors to enzymes; G-protein is like a switch turned on by receptor and hydrolyzing a phosphate turns off the receptor
^1664574050954

G-proteins have the intrinsic ability to ---::hydrolize; Can turn itself off by removing the phosphate back to GDP, making it GTP again (Receptor first turned it on when GP got phosphate from GTP, making it GDP)
^1664574050961

The single largest category of receptors in animal cells are ---::GPCRs; A worm has exactly 958 cells and >5% of proteins are GPCRs in these worms; Critical for animal cells
^1664574050968

G-proteins provide links between receptor that receives signal and ---::effector protein (usually an enzyme) that produces a cellular response
^1664574050974

Gated ion channels form a ---::pore through the plasma membrane that opens when the signaling molecule binds; The open pore then allows ions to flow into or out of the cell
^1664574050981

All G-proteins are --- when bound to GTP and --- when bound to GDP::active; inactive; Receptors act by coupling w/ a g-protein providing a link between receptors and effector proteins
^1664574050988

Kinases::Enzymes that phosphorylates something; Gets phosphates from ATP or GTP
^1664574050995

Scaffold proteins::Hold map kinases (kinases that stimulate cell division); Cascades from MKKK to MKK to MK then to response proteins; Improve efficiency but reduce amplification effect; Binds to each individual kinase such that they are spatially organized for optimal function
^1664574051003

[[2022-10-05]]
Map kinases stimulate --- and in scaffold proteins, they can interact with each other so that ---::cell division; when one protein is phosphorylated, another is phosphorylated than other in a series
^1665028593214

Intracellular second messengers::Chemical signals that cells say to do something quickly (lots in a chain of events); Often, effector proteins activated by G-proteins produce a second messenger
^1665028593223

Two common intracellular second messengers (effectors)::Adenylyl cyclase (Produces cAMP, which activates the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA)); Phospholipase C (PIP2 is acted on by effector protein phospholipase C)
^1665028593231

Adenylyl cyclase::Second messenger/effector protein; Activated by g-protein to produce cAMP, which activates kinase A (PKA); PKA adds phosphates to specific proteins
^1665028593239

When cAMP is present, cells must ---::get things done quickly; Binds to PKA (activated by g-protein and adenylyl cyclase), which then phosphorylates other proteins downstream of it
^1665028593246

Phospholipase C::Phosphorylation + lipid + enzyme; Associated w/ membranes and takes membrane-bound structure and reorganizes it to make other signaling molecules; Acts on PIP2 to produce IP3 plus DAG; Second messenger/effector
^1665028593253

After cleaving phosphates from ATP, you get to AMP then cyclic AMP (cAMP), which serves as a ---::second messenger to activate or inactivate proteins within the cell (intracellular)
^1665028593261

Termination of cAMP signal occurs when enzyme phosphodiesterase ---::converts cAMP into AMP; Caffeine interferes w/ this enzyme so cells continue to be very active
^1665028593269

RAS proteins::Small GTP-binding protein (g-protein); Link between the RTK and the MAP kinase cascade; Can normally turn itself off w/ innate hydrolyzing capabilities; Heterotrimeric g-proteins
^1665028593277

Heterotrimeric G-proteins have ---::A, B, and y subunits all linked together when inactive; Mutated in many human tumors, indicative of its role in linking growth factor receptors to their cellular response; When ligand binds to receptor, GTP plugged into a subunit (GDP --> GTP), causing a to separate from betta gamma pair; Then cellular response triggered by a or b y pair
^1665028593285

RAS can regulate ---::itself (stimulation by growth factors is short-lived); Innate hydrolysis abilities that can terminate signal (GTP --> GDP)
^1665028593293

Cholera::Ligand and toxin that binds to G-protein associated w/ receptor that can open a chloride channel in intestines; Cl ions pumped into intestines, causing water to follow the hih concentration of solute e (Cl-); Water flow cannot stop; Diarrhea --> dehydration --> death
^1665028593300

RAS protein is mutated in many ---::human tumors, indicative of role in linking growth factor to receptors to their cellular response; Can no longer hydrolyze resulting in uncontrolled cell growth; Cancerous tissues also don't have normal specialized functions and take resources from normal cells
^1665028593309

Receptor kinases::Kinases phosphorylate proteins to alter function; Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) associated w/ growth factors
^1665028593316

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)::Influence cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism, and cell proliferation (alteration in function can lead to cancer); Membrane receptor w/ single transmembrane domain (anchored to membrane); Extracellular ligand-binding domain, Intracellular kinase domain (catalytic site of receptor acts as protein kinase); When ligand binds, dimerization and autophosphorylation occurs and cell response follows depending on proteins
^1665028593324

Mutations in --- can cause cancer::RTKs; Carcinogens can bind to receptors such as RTK when its not the normal ligand, stimulating RTK then downstream stimulating RAS and eventually to transcription factors that get activated (bind to DNA and affect gene expression)
^1665028593332

A receptor tyrosine kinase is an ---::enzyme-linked receptor with a single transmembrane region, and extracellular and intracellular domains. Binding of a signaling molecule to the extracellular domain causes the receptor to dimerize. Tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain are then autophosphorylated, triggering a downstream cellular response. The signal is terminated by a phosphatase that removes the phosphates from the phosphotyrosine residues.
^1665028593339

If kinases turn things on, how do you turn things off?::Phosphatase (enzyme that removes a phosphate from a protein)
^1665028593347

Only three amino acids can be ---::phosphorylated; Tyrosine, Serine and threonine (extra methal group on threonine); Any protein that must be phosphorylated w// have on of these three at a specific location
^1665028593355

The --- of a protein tells you the order of amino acids::primary sequence; Kinases are either serine and threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases 
^1665028593364

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the ---::regulation of cell growth, wound healing, and tissue repair; When EGF binds to EGFR, a cascade of downstream events causes cell to grow and divide; If EGFR activated at inappropriate times, cancer may occur
^1665028593371

Translation is the process of ---::mRNA --> amino acids using ribosomes; mRNA is single stranded but it forms a loop at the end when it cannot be read by ribosome; Loop stops production until proteins are phosphorylated (allowing you to control when you can make proteins)
^1665028593379

Apoptosis::Programmed cell death; Times when you need your cells to die and can be intentional w/ positive outcomes; Embryo webbed feet example (webbing cells must go through apoptosis)
^1665028593386

The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down ---::PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve as second messengers.
^1665028593394

ERK is a ---::MAP kinase that activates translation when it is phosphorylated

^1665028593418

Mating factor is a ---::ligand that can bind on a receptor of receiving yeast cell, stimulating the exchange of genetic info
^1665028593426

Autoinducers are small molecules or proteins that can regulate ---::gene expression; Produced by bacteria that regulate gene expression; When cell density low, autoinducers diffuse away from the cell, but when high, more autoinducers are present and bind to receptors that regulate transcription of certain genes responsible for production of autoinducers (positive feedback loop)
^1665028593434

Cell-cell communication enables Staphylococcus aureus bacteria to work together to form a ---::biofilm inside a hospital patient’s catheter. S. aureus is the main cause of hospital-acquired infections.
^1665028593444

Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with the bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The luminescence makes it difficult to see the squid from below because it effectively eliminates its shadow. In return for camouflage, the squid provides ---::food for the bacteria. Free-living V. fischeri do not produce luciferase, the enzyme responsible for luminescence, but V. fischeri living in a symbiotic relationship with the squid do. Quorum sensing determines whether the bacteria should produce the luciferase enzyme.

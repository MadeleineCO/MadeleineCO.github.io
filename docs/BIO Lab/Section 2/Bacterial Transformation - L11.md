1. Genes to proteins
	- The goal of a living organism is to go from gene to protein
		1. For ex: 
			- gfp (gene) --> GFP (protein)
				1. Green florescent protein
			- bla (gene) --> BLA (protein)
				1. BLA gene expressed as ampicillin resistance
		2. A 2-step process
			- Must copy info (transcription)
			- Then turn it into protein (translation)
2. Transcription = copying info from DNA to RNA
	- Complementary base pairs (but NO thymine in RNA (uracil instead))
	- Takes place in nucleus
	- RNA polymerase is the enzyme that "reads" the *template strand* of DNA in order to produce mRNA
	- Template strand = strand of DNA that mRNA reads to eventually get translated
	- Coding strand = the other strand of DNA
3. Translation = using info from mRNA to create amino acid sequence (ex protein)
	- Occurs in cytoplasm in ribosomes
	- Proceeds from 5' --> 3' ends
	- mRNA reads 3 letters at a time in units called *codons*
		1. Each codon represents 20 amino acid possibilities
4. Transformation = the insertion of a gene from one organism to another organism
	- GMO = genetically modified organism
	- The inserted gene causes the 2nd organism to be "transformed" as it now expresses the inserted gene
		1. Ex: bacteria can be transformed to produce insulin
	- Accomplished using a *plasmid* in prokaryotes
		1. Plasmid = circular piece of DNA
5. Our Experiment
	- Insert one gene from a jellyfish (gfp) and another gene for ampicillin resistance (bla) into E. coli (type of bacteria)
	- Note: gfp gene only glows when in presence of sugar arabinose (ara)
	- Took two cultures of E. coli bacteria and attempted to transform one (the experimental group) while leaving other as is (the control group)
		1. Control = wild type
	- We did not know which one was transformed (A culture or B culture?)
	- Allowed both cultures to grow over a week (food = agar) then saw which one grew despite ampicillin and which one glowed in presence of ara
	- Results
		1. Plate LB (liquid broth; no ara, no ampicillin)
			- E. coli A grew but did not glow
			- E. coli B grew but did not glow
		2. Plate LB w/ ara (no ampicillin)
			- A grew but did not glow
			- B grew and glowed
		3. Plate LB w/ amp (no ara)
			- A did not grow or glow
			- B grew but did not glow
		4. Plate LB w/ amp and ara
			- A did not grow or glow
			- B grew and glowed
	- Conclusion
		1. A was the control group bc it never glowed (even in ara presence) and did not grow in presence of amp
		2. B was the transformed group bc it glowed in the presence of ara (due to gfp gene) and grew in the presence of amp (due to bla gene)

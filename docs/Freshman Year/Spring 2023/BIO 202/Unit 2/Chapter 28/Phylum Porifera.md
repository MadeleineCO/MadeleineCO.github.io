1. Kingdom Metazoa -> Phylum Porifera
2. Porifera = "porous"
	1. Sponges
	2. Most are marine organisms
3. Characteristics
	1. Functional tissues
		1. Specialized tissues and tasks
		2. Lack true tissues bc no gastrulation so no embryonic germ layers
		3. Lack organ systems bc they lack true tissues
	2. Asymmetric
	3. Important Structures
		2. Spongocoel
			1. Internal cavity of a sponge
		3. Ostia & Osculum
			1. Ostia = pores water can enter through
			2. Osculum = how water escapes 
		4. Mesophyll = jelly filling 
			1. Has amoeba sites embedded inside
				1. Delivers nutrients 
				2. Amoebocyte cells are considered stem cells 
					1. Can transform types
		5. Spicules
			1. Inorganics that provide rigid support
			2. Some sponges only have spicules
		6. Spongin
			1. Provides flexible support
			2. Some sponges have mixture of spicules and spongin
		7. See diagram on slideshow 
4. Four Classes of Sponges
	1. Hexactinellid
		1. Glass sponges
		2. No spongin, only hard spicules 
	2. Calcarea
		1. Calcareous sponges
			1. Spicules made of calcium carbonate
		2. No spongin
	3. Demospongia
		1. Demosponges
		2. Has both spongin and spicules 
		3. Some freshwater species
	4. Sclerospongiae
		1. Coralline sponges
			1. Layers of calcium carbonate
		2. Discovered in underwater tunnels
5. Ecology
	1. Mostly marine
	2. Mobile larvae
		1. Ciliated 
	3. Sessile adults
		1. Stationary 
6. Feeding and Digestion
	1. Filter feeders
	2. Use choanocytes to move water
	3. Intracellular digestion
	4. Ostia -> Osculum
		1. Water goes in the ostia and out the osculum
7. Reproduction
	1. Monoecious
		1. No separate sexes
		2. Both male and female
	2. Gemmules
		1. Produced by demosponges
		2. FW spp
		3. Little granules that provide environmental resistance
	3. Amoebocyte -> egg
		1. Amoebocyte releases eggs into water
8. Choanoflagellates & Sponges
	1. Ex of Endosymbiosis 
	2. Cells are more autonomous than in true tissues
9. Amazonian Sponge Reef?
	1. Discovered in 2017
	2. Huge sponge reef was found of coast of Brazil in the mouth of the Amazon
	3. Oil survey team discovered the reef
	4. 620 miles long or 3600 sq mi (greater than area of metro Atlanta)
10. Phylogenetic Reminder #1
	1. Metazoan 
	2. Parazoan 
	3. Porifera

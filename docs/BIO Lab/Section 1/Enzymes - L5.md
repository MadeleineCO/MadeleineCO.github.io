1.Enzymes are special proteins that lower activation energy
	- Act as catalysts to speed up reactions
2. Lock and key
	- Enzymes are specific to certain things
3. pH and Temperature
	- Too acidic or too basic can denature enzymes
	- Too cold or too hot prevents can denature them as well
	- Causes enzyme to come apart if not suitable environment
		1. If you change shape, you change (or prevent) function
4. The reaction
	- 2 H2O2 --> 2 H2O + O2
	- Substrate = hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
	- Products = water (H2O) and oxygen (O2)
	- Enzyme = peroxidase (from turnips)
		1. Enzymes often end in "ase"
	- Guaiacol is a color changing indicator and not essential to reaction. Allow us to see formation of products (which are colorless). Becomes darker as enzymatic reaction progresses.
	- Catabolic reaction
		1. Catabolic = breaking down
		2. Hydrogen peroxide is broken down into two separate products (water and oxygen)
5. The experiments
	- Baseline peroxidase enzyme reaction
	- Effect of pH on peroxidase activity
		1. Testing levels 3-8 
	- Effect of temperature on peroxidase activity
		1. Ice, room, 35*, 45* 60* Centigrade

Functions of Circulatory System::*Transportation* (nutrients, glucose, metabolic waste), *Regulation* (hormones, temp), and *Protection* (injury and clotting, pathogens and WBCs)
^1681866093402

Dilation (more open vessels) can help ---::cooling; Form of regulation; Constriction = heat conservation
^1681866093412

Some insects (such as ticks) prevent proteins like platelets from clotting properly so ---::they can continuously feed
^1681866093418

Sponges have no true ---::tissues; Must be surrounded by water (circ fluid); Specialized cells bring water in ostia and out ostium; Every cell must be in contact w/ water
^1681866093425

GVS::Seen in flatworms and cnidarians; Most cells in contact w/ water (circ fluid); Two-cells thick
^1681866093432

In Nematodes, body fluids act as the ---::circ fluid; Pseudocoelomates; Small size so that cells can maintain contact and simply use diffusion
^1681866093439

Open circulatory systems are seen in ---::Arthropods; No distinction between body fluids and circ fluids (hemolymph = combined fluids); Heart -> fluid -> channels and cavities; Drains back to heart
^1681866093446

Closed (complete) circulatory systems first seen in ---::Annelids; Completely separate circ fluid; Heart -> arteries -> tissues (oxygenated); Tissues -> veins -> heart (deoxygenated)
^1681866093453

Fish (CCS)::Two chambered heart; Advantage = keeps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separate; Systematic loop only
^1681866093460

The disadvantage of two chambered heart in fish is ---::low blood pressure
^1681866093468

Electrical impulses (SV) allow the heart to initiate ---::its own electrical stimulation; Sinoatrial node in the right atrium
^1681866093475

Fish flow diagram::![[Pasted image 20230417111912.png]]
^1681866093483

Amphibians have a --- chambered heart::three; Double circulation (systematic (body), pulmonary (lungs), and cutaneous (skin)); Blood mixture in ventricle decreases efficiency (almost but not quite complete)
^1681866093492

Amphibians' three chambered heart limits ---::thermal regulation and metabolic rate; Low MR
^1681866093500

^1681866093545

Animals w/ a four chambered heart have a --- metabolic rate::higher; More internal regulation; No blood mixing helps maintain temp

Heart rate is regulated by the ---::SA node; Automatic NS can increase or decrease HR
^1682040071200

Atria::Right (body); Left (lungs); When pressure increases, atrioventricular valves open; 80% of blood goes to ventricles; 20% for atria contraction; Fills relaxed ventricles (*diastole*)
^1682040071205

Ventricles::Contract (*systole*); AV forcibly close (LUB; pressure increases and SLs open and blood goes to vessels); SL close (DUB)
^1682040071210

Electrical Excitation::1 - Heart at rest (no stimulus); 2 - Sinoatrial node fires (APS spread through atria, which contracts so APs spread to AV-node); 3 - AV node fires (stimulated by SA AP and sends impulses down myoseptum that cause ventricles to contract)
^1682040071215

Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)::1 - P-wave (atrial contraction/depolarization);2 - QRS  complex (systole (120 mmHg); ventricular contraction/depolarization);3 - T-wave (distole (80 mmHg); ventricular relaxation/repolarization)
^1682040071221

The anode location flips the EKG signal so that the T-wave appears like its ---::positive on the EKG when it's really more negative (repolarization)
^1682040071226

^1682040071304

Platelets::Cellular fragments created by megakaryocyte; Initiate blood clotting
^1682040071309

During blood clotting, platelets adhere to ---::exposed collagen; Prothrombin and fibrinogen are inactive proteins that activate when clotting is necessary
^1682040071315

Prothrombin can turn into ---::thrombin and use fibrinogen to create fibrin (makes fibrous network); Clotting
^1682040071320

Arteries::Thick, smooth muscles capable of forceful contraction; Allows us to regulate body heat (cold = vasoconstriction; hot = vasodilation)
^1682040071326

F (volume flowrate) = ---::(P1 - P2) / R; R (resistance to flow) = 8nL / pir^2; Because radius is to the fourth power when calculating R, even a small change in r causes a great change in R
^1682040071332

Arteries have more --- layers and --- CT::elastic; thinner; Arteries get smaller and become arterioles, which become capillaries
^1682040071337

Skeletal muscle is important for veins because ---::varicose veins allow for voluntary expansion (associated w/ muscles)
^1682040071361

Capillaries can get as small as ---::1 cell thick (1 mm length); Helps w/ exchange and absorption of nutrients, gasses, water, etc; Greatest cross-sectional area
^1682040071367

Atherosclerosis (CVD)::High blood pressure and high cholesterol (can be genetic, high sodium diet, etc.); Plaque formation causes vessel blockage (heart attack = dead tissue bc cannot get blood)

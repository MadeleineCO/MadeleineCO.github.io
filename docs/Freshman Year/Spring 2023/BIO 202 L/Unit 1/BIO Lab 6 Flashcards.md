Coelom refers to an animal's ---::body cavity; Only seen in triploblasts; Indicates bilateral symmetry; Derived from the mesoderm (between the endo and ecto)
^1676511335692

In roundworms, repro structures lay in the ---::pseudocoelom
^1676511335702

True coelomates::Eucoelomates; Complete digestive system; Coelom is completely lined by the mesoderm; Can be protostomes or deuterostomes (phylum mollusca, annelida, and arthropoda are all proto)
^1676511335711

Phylum Mollusca (mollusks)::Protostomes; Eucoelomates; Body arrangement includes head, unique body plan, complete gut; Shells or floats for body support
^1676511335718

Mollusk organ systems::NS w/ ganglia; Excretory system utilizing nephridia; Open circulatory system; Respiratory system using gills or lungs
^1676511335724

Mollusk's exterior body plan involves a ---::head, mantle, and foot; foot for mobility, radula = rasping tongue; mantle creates shell
^1676511335732

Ex of classes within Phylum Mollusca::Class Bivalvia (mussels, scallops, and oysters); Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs, and conch); Class Cephalopoda (squid, octopus, and chambered nautilus)
^1676511335741

Phylum Annelida (segmented worm)::Protostome; Hermaphroditic; Head, segmented body, and complete gut (1st appearance of segmentation); Coelom is lined by peritoneum within each segment; Septum (clear transverse piece of tissue between segments); Larval stages; Hydrostatic body support
^1676511335749

Annelids have no --- system::respiratory; exchanges gasses through skin
^1676511335756

Clitellum::Aids in reproduction in Annelids; Anterior end is closest to the clitellum; lighter band on earthworms; Can preform sexual and asexual reproduction
^1676511335762

In earthworms, the --- side is darker than the ---::dorsal; ventral side
^1676511335769

Annelids have a --- circulatory system::closed
^1676511335776

Earthworms belong to Phylum ---::Annelida
^1676511335783

Phylum Arthropoda::Bilateral; Three body regions (head, thorax, and abdomen); Segmentation; Organ systems (nervous, excretory, OCS); "Breath" through gills or book lungs; Body supported by chitin exoskeleton
^1676511335791

Arthropod Repro::Sexual; Have larvae stages (incomplete metamorphosis; some (ex butterflies) have complete metamorphosis), and some parthenogenesis; Ex: cricket, crayfish
^1676511335799

Bivalves include ---::clams, mussels, scallops, and oysters; Phylum Mollusca
^1676511832626

Gastropods include ---::snails, slugs, nudibranchs, and conch; Phylum Mollusca
^1676511832638

Cephalopods include ---::squid, octopus, chambered nautilus; Phylum Mollusca
^1676511832645

Cricket diagram parts (P. Arthropoda)::Brain, crop, stomach, ovary, intestine, rectum, oviduct (if female); Gastric cecum; Ventral nervous system
^1676511832655

Crayfish diagram parts (P. Arthropoda)::Mouth, stomach, ovary (if female), heart, intestine, ventral nerve cord, anus; Different between male and female = females have many shorter and more uniform egg holders on underside of tail while males have fewer, longer sperm dispensers
^1676511832662

Earthworm internal anatomy diagram (P. Annelid)::Cerebral ganglion, Pharynx, Pharyngeal muscles, Seminal receptacles, Aortic arches, Seminal vesicles, Esophagus, Ovary and Oviduct (if female), Crop, Gizzard, Dorsal blood vessels, Intestine, Septae, Protonephridia, Ventral blood vessel, Ventral nerve cord
^167651183266976511832669

In deuterostomes, the blastopore forms into the ---::anus; Radial and indeterminate cleavage; Eucoelom formed by outpocketing of  archenteron; Ex: Phylum Echinodermata (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, sea lilies, sea urchins, sea daisies)
^1676768796493

Phylum Mollusca, Phylum Annelida, Phylum Arthropoda, and Phylum Echinodermata are all ---::eucoelomates; M, A, A = protostomes; E = deuterostome; All Bilateral

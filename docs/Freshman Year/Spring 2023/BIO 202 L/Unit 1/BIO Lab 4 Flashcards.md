The more than 700 islands of the Caribbean are home to about --- spp of anoles, a group of lizards of the genus *Anolis*::150
^1675301785970

Ecomorphs::Groups of lizards that occupy different niches in the environment; General categories of lizards (ex twig lizards, ground lizards, canopy lizards); Same types of ecomorphs seen on different islands 
^1675301785979

Adaption::A structure of function that confers greater ability to survive and reproduce in a particular environment
^1675301785985

Species (biol)::A group of interbreeding individuals that are reproductively, and thus genetically, isolated from other groups
^1675301785992

Different species can independently evolve similar traits by adapting to similar env or ecological niches in a phenomenon known as ---::convergent evolution; Seen in lizard species
^1675301785998

When two groups within a species become geographically isolated, genetic changes in one group will not be shared w/ members of ---::the other and vise versa; Can lead to allopatric speciation over time
^1675301786003

The lizards all faced similar selection pressures on different islands and so developed similar ecomorphs due to ---::convergent evolution; More related to other island species in different ecomorphs than species on other islands in the same ecomorph
^1675301786009

Canopy lizards::Long body, Short limbs, Large toepads, Long tail, Usually green, Live in high trunks and branches
^1675301786015

Trunk-crown lizards::Medium body, Short limbs, Very large toepads, Long tail, Green, Live in trunks, branches, and leaves
^1675301786021

Trunk lizards::Short body, Intermediate limbs, Intermediate toepads, Short tail, Gray, Live on trunks
^1675301786027

Twig lizards::Medium body, Very short limbs, Small toepads, Short tail, Gray, Live on narrow twigs
^1675301786033

Trunk-ground lizards::Medium body, Long limbs, Intermediate toepads, Long tail, Brown, Live on lower trunks and ground
^1675301786038

Grass-bush lizards::Short body, Long limbs, Intermediate toepads, Very long tail, Brown, Live in bushes and grasses
^1675301786044

Male anoles use color flaps of skin under their throats, called dewlaps, to court ---::females and confront other males; Dewlaps also help lizards distinguish members of their own spp from other spp; No two spp of anoles living in the same geographic location have dewlaps of the same size, shape, or color
^1675301786051

If a group of anoles from a spp w/ light colored dewlaps migrated from dim forests to open and sunny place, the light dewlaps would be too difficult to see so over many generations, the lizards may develop ---::dull-colored dewlaps that stand out better against a bright background; Reproductive isolation between spp in forest and spp in sunny areas
^1675301786057

When lizards w/ different dewlap colors colonize neighboring niches such as twigs or canopies, they will not ---::interbreed; Do not share genetic changes so spp free to diverge even further in form and function; This led to different body types and skin colors of lizards today

Were anoles on the same island (e.g., Puerto Rico) more closely related to one another or were anoles of the same ecomorph (e.g., grass-bush) more closely related?::Same island
^1676303825576

We used several different traits to make comparisons between anole species, but what trait or information was ultimately used to construct the phylogenetic tree that showed the evolutionary relationships of the anoles?::DNA
^1676303825594

Why did you determine **relative** hindlimb length in anoles?::It allowed you to more directly compare the hindlimbs from anoles of different body sizes
^1676303825602

The anoles that we studied have **dewlaps**. What is a dewlap used for?::Visual communication; To attract females
^1676303825608

The virtual lizard lab ultimately found that lizards who belong to the same ecomorph type are similar due to similar environmental selection pressures (e.g., the need to not fall off of twigs).  What evolutionary term is associated with this?::Convergent evolution

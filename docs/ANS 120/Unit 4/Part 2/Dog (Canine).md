1. [[Companion Animals]]
2. [[Domestication]]
	- Self [[domestication]] first ("village dump analogy")
		1. Develop some tameness
		2. Earliest domesticated creatures
		3. Domesticated for food first
	- Specialization by humans
		1. Strict captivity and limited breeding
		2. Intentional breeding
			- Looking for specific traits
				1. Ex: long nose, white fur, etc.
		3. Trait standardization
			1. Define breeds and traits
			2. Certain phenotypes = certain breed
				- Genetically still very similar to wolf, but many phenotypical differences
		4. Genetic firewall
			1. Minimize genes from wild species
			2. Toy poodle cannot breed with a wolf
			3. Russian scientist Dmitri Belyaev - Russian Silver fox
				- These foxes hunted for their fur
				- He bred them in captivity for 60 years
				- Directly selected for "temperament"
					1. Wanted animals he could work around
					2. 130 foxes classified by how aggressive or fearful they were
						- Aggressive fearful, extremely aggressive, fearful, or quiet (limited fear and aggression)
						- Selected "quiet" for breeding
						- Reverse flight zone
							1. Test to see how aggressive and/or fearful
				- By 8th generation, white stars on foreheads appeared. By 15th generation, they had floppier ears, play in adulthood, barking, dog-like coat, changes in estrous cycles
			5. Other [[domestication]] changes
				- Wolves have larger skull and more brain capacity
					1. Working dogs have relatively more brain capacity that lap dogs
						- Herding, working, bird, etc.
				- DNA
					1. Took DNA from wolf and DNA from 18 dog breeds and did basic DNA analysis
					2. Chromosomes - "blueprint" or "software"
					3. Sequences on nucleic acid bases
						- ATGC
					4. Gel electrophoresis
						- DNA is negative
						- Positive and neg charges on the gell so DNA moves towards positive. Bigger pieces more closer to pos than smaller pieces. Separates DNA fragments based on size and electrical charge.
					5. Genetic Timing = Genes are very similar between wolves and dogs. However, activation or expression of the genes influencing phenotype ends up varying. 
						- Genes similar. Expression differs.
						- Some gene expression activated sooner, some remain activated longer, some are limited or never activate
						- Genes control one protein whereas traits are often made up of many genes
						- Long nose, short nose, floppy ears, pointed ears, etc. 
							1. Genes similar but "turn on" differently
						- If you look at puppies, they all look similar at birth
							1. Genetic timing explains differences in phenotypes
					6. Modern wolf have more genes similar to dogs than ancient wolves
						- ---
						- Some evidence that dog [[domestication]] occurred several times 
						- All animals change somewhat over time
				- From mental and behavioral standpoint, we have selected animals that never grow up mentally
					1. Dogs get stuck in puppy land :)
					2. Some wolf/domestic dog intermixing and breeding
3. Whether their [[Carnivores]] or [[Omnivores]] depends on definition
4. Dog breeds
	- All same genus + species
	- Many, many different established breeds
	- Top US breeds = retrievers (lab), germen shepherds, retrievers (golden), french bulldogs
		1. Least popular dogs tend to be specialized working dogs
			- Less social and have jobs
5. [[Canine Anatomy and Physiology]] ([[Equine Anatomy & Physiology]])
7. What happens to a breed when its job is gone
	- Ex Bulldogs
		1. Shortened head, broadened hips, wrinkly skin w/ issues
	- Ex: Dogsence became shorter
	- Greyhound racing is now banned
		1. When dog loses its job, we end up losing the dog
			- Begin to propagate issues
	- Double muscling
		1. Not ideal for the dog
		2. Not agile
	- Ugly dog contests 
	- Loving pets to death
		1. Level of obesity increasing
		2. Most animals are designed for scarcity

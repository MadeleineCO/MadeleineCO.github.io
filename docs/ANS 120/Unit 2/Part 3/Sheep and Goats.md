1. Among the earliest domesticated species ([[Domestication]])
2. Differences between sheep and goats
	- Hair coat
		1. Goats only have hair
		2. Most sheep have wool, but some hair breeds
	- Tails
		1. Sheep have long tails
		2. Goats have short, vertical tails
	- Horns
		1. Goats have narrow, curving horns
		2. Sheep have broad, curling horns if present
	- Upper lip
		1. Goats = continuous
		2. Sheep = separate lobes
	- Genetic
		1. Goats have 60 chromosomes
		2. Sheep have 54
		3. Cannot be crossed
	- Diet
		1. Goats do NOT eat everything
			- Broader diet than sheep
			- Can still be picky eaters
			- Browsing animal
				1. Prefer leaves, vines, forbs, fruit, nuts, tender shrubs, young bark
				2. Very wide variety of forages
				3. Concentrate selectors 
					- Have smaller rumen than sheep
		1. Sheep prefer a smaller variety of food
			- Grazing animal
				1. More limited variety of forages
				2. Prefer grasses, legumes, and weeds
					- NOT exclusive, only preference 
					- Bigger rumen than goats bc more fibrous material
				3. Harder for necks to reach up high than goats
	3. Sheep
		- Among earliest [[domestication|domesticated]]
			1. Herd-oriented
			2. Not self-domesticated
				- Intentional domestication
			3. Smaller
			4. Lots of product
				- Meat, fiber, leather
		- Terms
			1. Parturition = lambing 
			2. Intact male = ram
			3. Castrated male = wether
			4. Female = ewe
			5. Young male = ram lamb
			6. Young female = ewe lamb
			7. All young = lambs
		- Mouflon
			1. Ancestor of all sheep
			2. Developed domesticated sheep from wild mouflon
		- Reproduction
			1. Seasonal breeders
				- Short day breeders
				- Only have estrous cycles as light decreases and darkness increases over a 24 hr period
					1. Fall/winter in northern hemisphere
						- Dec 21 is the equinox (NH) and the peak
					2. Anestrous = without estrus
						- Spring/summer in northern hemisphere
			1. Normally 17 day estrous cycle
			2. Estrus = 30 hours
			3. Gestation = 147 days
				- Lambing in spring as forage starts growing
			4. Puberty = 6-8 months
			5. Life cycle
				- Day 0 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
				- Day 147 (lambing from Mar to Apr)
					1. Castration of most males
					2. Young animal vaccinations 
				- Day 200 (weaning from May to June)
					1. Weaning = Process of separation of the dam and offspring  
				- Day 260 (market lambs from July to Aug for meat producing animals)
					1. Market lambs = lambs sold to meat market
					2. Around July or August
					3. Meat lambs, not wool lambs
					4. Get rid of castrated males and most of ewe lambs
						- Must keep some for breeding
				- Day 365 (breeding season from Sept to Nov)
					1. Cycle repeats
		- Types of sheep
			1. Wool
				- Diameter of wool fiber (17-40 microns)
				- Fine wool = smaller diameter
					1. Human hair is 40-300 microns
					2. 150-250 lbs.
					3. Midwest and West

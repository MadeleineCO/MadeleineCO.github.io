1. [[Gene Expression]]
2. Most [[DNA]]-binding proteins bind in the major groove of the double helix
	- DNA is 2 nm in diameter, so when proteins bind, you bend [[DNA]]
		1. Local distortion
	- DNA-Binding Motifs are regions of regulatory proteins that bind to [[DNA]]
	- Functional groups that stick off base pairs are functionally different 
		1. Physical features that define AT base pair vs GC base pair
		2. Those different features face the major groove
		3. Proteins w/ their R groups can bind to the major groove and temporarily form H bonds
	- Different characteristic/components of DNA binding proteins
		1. Can determine [[Protein]] based on structural differences 
			- Can identify unknown [[Protein]] based off these features
				1. If it has one of these, it is [[DNA]] binding [[Protein]]
		1. Helix-turn-helix motif
			- Also called homeodomain motif
				1. Domain = region of [[Protein]]
			- Region that has two alpha helixes
				1. One lies directly in major groove and other is perpendicular to groove
		2. Zinc finger motif
		3. Leucine zipper motif
			- The alpha helixes are in adjacent major grooves
3. Regulation differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
	- Prokaryotes
		1. Lack nucleus
		2. Circular chromosomes
		3. [[DNA]] found in cytoplasm
		4. Transcription and translation occur nearly simultaneously
		5. Regulation primarily at level of transcription
			- If you control transcription, you control translation
	- Eukaryotes
		1. Contains nucleus
		2. [[DNA]] confined to nucleus
			- Access to [[DNA]] is more complicated
		3. Transcription occurs prior to translation which only occurs in the cytoplasm
		4. Regulation at many levels
		5. Primary transcript = just produced RNA (unprocessed)
			- Processing turns RNA into mature RNA
				1. Must methylate, cut out introns, add poly-A tail, add 5' cap

1. Vision
	- [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] have semitransparent cornea on outside of eye
		1. Function of cornea
			- Allows light to enter eye
			- Protects from light that may hurt eye
	- Pupil = regulates intensity of light entering eye
		1. Contracts under high light
		2. Dilates under low light
	- Lens = Bends and focuses light on the back of eye (called retna)
	- Retna = Contains rods and cones (two types of nerves)
		- Specialized sensory nerves that take light photon and stimulates brain
		- Rods work in low-light conditions
			1. Tapetum = Reflective layer of cells right behind the retina
				- Causes light to bounce back
				- Allows light to hit rods again, amplifying light
				- Allows horses to see even better in dark than we can
		- Cones help us see color
			1. People have far more cones than [[Horse (Equine)|horses]]
				- We are trichromic (three specialized cones)
					1. Blue, green, and red
					2. Short wavelength = blue 
					3. Middle wavelength = green
					4. Long = red
					5. Different wavelengths stimulate different cones
				- [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] are dichromic
					1. Short wave = blue
					2. Middle/long wave = yellow/brown (earth tones)
		- Most animals have more rods and fewer cones
			1. Humans are opposite
			2. [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] can see better in low light conditions than us
	- [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] have eyes closer to sides of head
		1. Prey usually have eyes on sides and predators tend to be on front
		2. Stereoscopic better long range depth perception
			- Helps with running
		3. 357* vision
		4. Blind spots directly in front and directly behind
		5. Poor short range depth perception
		6. Accommodation = ability for lens to focus 
			- Lens changes shape; the more it can change shape, the more it can focus close and far
			- [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] have 1-2 diopters
				1. Humans is closer to 10 diopters
				2. Horses have more fixed lens
					- Can see far away well 
					- Difficult to focus close up
						1. Creates problems inside barns and constricted spaces 
	- [[Horse (Equine)|Equine]] Vision
		1. Greater low light vision (rods + tapetum)
		2. Limited color vision (dichromic = short wave/blue and middle/long/yellow browns)
		3. Limited accommodation (distance focused (different from farsighted in humans))
2. Limb Anatomy
	- Increase in body mass and increase in length of limb over time
		1. As you increase limb length, you increase height and increase stride length (*potential* to increase speed)
			- Speed = Stride length x frequency of stride
		2. Increase weight --> slower movement
		3. Higher center of gravity --> stability problem
		4. Solutions to these issues
			- Weight
				1. Eliminated excess weight through bone and muscle
				2. From knee down in horse, virtually no muscle 
			- Stability
				1. Backbone is only a semiflexible spine
				2. Fusion of radius/ulna
					- We can twist our arms but in horses, they are fused
					- Front legs
				3. Fusion of tibia/fibula
					- Back legs 
		5. [[Horse (Equine)|Horse]] leg bones to human comparisons (Need to know. See graphics)
			- Scapula = shoulder blade
			- Humerus = Upper arm and elbow
			- Radius/Ulna = forearm
			- Knee = Wrist
			- Metacarpal and Cannon = Hand
			- Fetlock = Knuckle
			- Prox Phalanx, Med Phalanx, and Dist Phalanx = Finger
			- ---
		6. Stride Anatomy
			- Flexion = Power stroke
			- Extension = Reach for the next step
3. Digestive System
	- [[Non-Ruminant Herbivores]]
	- If both horse and cow are 1000 lbs, feed intake is similar
		1. Horses have smaller GIT so have faster rate of passage than cows
			- Must also eat more frequently
				1. Eat about 20 hrs of the day
				2. Take cat naps
				3. Prone to colic when in stalls 
					- Must maintain sufficient fiber to keep GIT from twisting
			- Smaller GIT means less mass in GIT
				1. More muscle/unit mass vs bovine
			- Horses designed for running
4. O2 capacity
	- Oxygen is used in ATP production
		1. Necessary for muscle contractions
	- If not enough O2, go into anaerobic metabolism
		1. Still have muscle contractions but creates lactic acid
		2. Sore and stiff muscles 
	- Must be able to move air quickly
	- Head anatomy designed for air intake
		1. Large diameter
		2. Separate from mouth/esophagus
			- We can breath through our mouth down the trachea but [[Horse (Equine)|horses]] cannot 
			- Horses can only breath through sinus passages so they cannot choke
	- Spleen
		1. In most species, spleen recycles red blood cells 
		2. [[Horse (Equine)|Horses]] can use spleen for storage as well
			- Hematocrit = The proportion of cells (all types) to fluid
				1. When you centrifuge blood, cells go to bottom and serum goes to top
				2. Can use this to look for anemia or dehydration 
					- Anemia = lacking cells
					- Dehydration = too little serum
				3. A [[Horse (Equine)|horse]] can increase hematocrit by 10-20% by releasing stored RBCs from the spleen
					- When feeling out of breath, a horse increases num of RBCs so it can carry more oxygen (avoiding anaerobic metabolism)
	- Efficiency of Muscle Contractions
		1. Slow = low efficiency
			- Limited work
			- Limited heat lost as friction
			- Walk = 4 beat gait
		2. Fast = low efficiency
			- High work
			- High heat - friction
			- Canter = 3 beat gait
		3. Moderate = high efficiency
			- Moderate work
			- Moderate heat - friction
			- trot/pace = 2 beat gait
5. Conformation of [[Horse (Equine)|horse]]
	- Conformation = all the parts together
		1. Function to form
			- We select different characteristics to match function
			- Draft very different from jumping horse
	- Ideals = Head and neck important for balance and flexibility as well as air intake, refined head, straight shot for air, large eyes, shorter loin/back, lot of muscle in hindquarters, deep girth
		1. Back should match front

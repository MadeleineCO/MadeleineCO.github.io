1. Sheep Industry in the U.S.
	1. Small compared to beef, dairy, etc.
	2. Purebred
		1. Seedstock for commercial producers
		2. Show sheep (4-H)
			1. Club lambs
			2. Purebred breeders that trade among themselves ("collectors")
			3. Show sheep
	3. Commercial
		1. Lamb/meat 
			1. Majority of income
		2. Wool
			1. Secondary income in Western U.S.
			2. Expense/breakeven in Eastern U.S.
				1. Not profitable in the east 
		3. Dairy
			1. Raised for cheese
			2. Produced in the Great Lakes region
2. Traits of Economic Importance
	1. Meat production
		1. Num of lambs born/weaned
			1. More lambs = better sustainability and more to sell for meat 
		2. Growth rate
			1. Feed Efficiency
	2. Wool production
		1. Fiber diameter
			1. Fine wool is better
		2. Fleece wgt
	3. Milk
		1. Pounds per lactation
	4. Heritability of Economically Important Traits![[Pasted image 20230329101545.png]]
		1. Don't need to memorize numbers, just know traits we select for
		2. Low h^2 w/ reproductive traits
			1. Prolificacy = Produces many lambs 
		3. Mod h^2 w/ growth traits 
		4. Low to mod h^2 w/ carcass traits
			1. Dressing % = Dressed wgt/Live wgt  x 100
		5. Mod to high h^2 w/ fleece traits
			1. Don't encourage crossbreeding for these traits 
			2. Selection is more productive
3. Breeds of Sheep
	1. At least 425 breeds of sheep world-wide
	2. 47 breeds of sheep in the U.S.
		1. U.S. sheep industry is very willing to try and use new breeds to meet needs
4. Sheep Selection
	1. Inbreeding
		1. Seen some in purebreds (especially those w/ smaller nums or imported breeds w/ limited nums)
	2. Crossbreeding
		1. Used extensively in commercial production
	3. EPDs
		1. Not as developed as in cattle
		2. National Sheep Improvement Program
			1. Calculates cross-flock EPDs for sheep
				1. Only for Targhee, Suffolk, Polypay, Dorset, Hampshire, Columbia, Katahdin, Romney
			2. Not widely used in most breeds
	4. Central Ram Tests
		1. Popular in Western States
		2. Most effective for traits of mod to high h^2 that can be measured in a young, growing ram
			1. Specifically for growth
		3. Problem = you emphasize growth over other traits
			1. Emphasizing easily measured traits at expense of other traits 
5. Inherited Diseases and Genetic Testing
	1. Spider Syndrome
		1. Lethal or semi-lethal skeletal abnormalities 
		2. Found in Suffolk, Hampshire, Shropshire, Southdown, and Oxford breeds
		3. Caused by a single, autosomal recessive gene
		4. Gene affected = fibroblast growth factor receptor
		5. Genetic tests are available so you don't cross heterozygotes
	2. Scrapie
		1. CNS disease similar to. . .
			1. Bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE)
				1. AKA mad cow disease
			2. Chronic wasting disease (CWD in deer and elk)
			3. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CDJ in humans)
		2. Caused by abnormal prion protein 
		3. Calculated prevalence in U.S. is 0.2%
			1. 1 in 500 mature ewes 
		4. Consumer perception
			1. Some serious negative impact
				1. $20-25 million annually to US sheep industry due to. . .
					1. Lost export opportunities
					2. Increased offal disposal costs
					3. Reduced productivity
			2. Scrapie has been a known disease since 1732 but has never been transmitted to humans
		5. Symptoms
			1. Individual sheep or goats w/ scrapie will often rub on objects and *scrape* off their wool/hair
			2. ---
		6. Diagnosis
			1. Can only be diagnosed in dead animals
				1. Examination of brain and lymph nodes for lesions of scrapie and presence of abnormal prions
				2. ---
			2. In live animals, examination of the third eyelid for abnormal prion protein
				1. Highly ---
				2. ---
		7. Scrapie Susceptibility 
			1. Commercial test for variations in prion proteins
			2. Codon 136
				1. AA low susceptibility, AV or VV high susceptibility
			3. Codon 154
				1. RR no effect, HR or HH overrides Q171 in some cases
			4. Codon 171
				1. QR or RR low susceptibility, QQ high susceptibility
			5. ---
			6. Know that we check these three codons
	3. Genes for important traits
		1. Booroola Gene
			1. Discovered in Merino in Australia
			2. Increases ovulation rate (1.5 ova for each copy)
				1. Causes high litter size
				2. Also results in poor lamb survival, lamb growth, and ewe conception 
			3. Mapped to chromosome 6
			4. AKA Fec or fecundancy allele
		2. Callipyge Gene
			1. Muscle hypertrophy (increased muscle mass)
				1. Only manifest in offspring one month after birth (does not lead to birth difficulties)
			2. Mapped to telomeric region of chromosome 18
			3. Connected w/ high dressing % and larger loin eye
				1. Accompanied by decrease in all measures of fatness (lean meat is good)
				2. Affected animals also have improved feed efficiency
			4. Problem = extremely tough meat
				1. Not propagated in the U.S.
			5. Mode of inheritance = polar overdominance
				1. Epigenetic 
				2. Animals w/ one copy from sire express the trait
				3. Animals w/ one copy from dam are normal
				4. Two copies = normal

Sexual life cycle::made up meiosis and fertilization; Meiosis results in haploid gamete and fertilization results in diploid zygote
^1665794903543

Diploid cells::Somatic cells of adult have 2 sets of chromosomes; Mitosis results in diploid cells
^1665794903560

Haploid cells::Meiosis results in haploid cells (gametes); 23 chromosomes total; Egg or sperm
^1665794903567

Offspring inherit genetic material from 2 parents::2 haploid sets = 1 diploid set; Egg (23c) + Sperm (23c) = zygote (46c); Allows you to get characteristics from both  parents
^1665794903575

Life cycles of sexually reproducing organisms involve ---::the alternation of haploid and diploid stages; Some life cycles include longer diploid phases and some include longer haploid phases; In most animals, diploid state dominates
^1665794903584

Zygote first undergoes mitosis to produce ---::diploid cells; Later in the life cycle, some of those diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes
^1665794903591

The length of sexual life cycle ---::varies widely; Some animals reproduce rapidly (ex insects); Human gestation = 9m; Elephant gestation = 18m; Birds lay eggs and incubation times can differ (usually multiples of seven like 21 or 28d); Desert plant called century plant reproduces once every 100yr
^1665794903600

Meiosis::Includes two rounds of division (Meiosis I and Meiosis II); Each has prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages
^1665794903608

Prophase I::Homologous chromosomes become closely associated (condense and become visible to microscope); Includes formation of synaptonemal complex (Also called tetrad or bivalents); Form synapse
^1665794903615

Early in prophase I, homologous chromosomes come together to for a ---::synapse; The chromosomes are bound tightly together and in perfect alignment by a protein lattice called a synaptonemal complex and by cohesion proteins at the centromere
^1665794903622

[[2022-10-22]]
The longer arm is --- and the shorter arm is ---::Q; P
^1666470494791

Crossing over::Occurs in prophase I; Genetic recombination between nonsister chromatids (one from father and one from mother); Allows homologues to exchange chromosomal material; Creates genetic diversity
^1666470494802

When lined up by the protein lattice (synaptonemal complex), nonsister chromatids can exchange ---::nucleotides of DNA to make new combination of genes; Ends of chromosomes (closer to telomeres) tend to cross over more than regions closer to centromeres
^1666470494809

Chiasmata::Site of crossing over during prophase I; Contact maintained until anaphase I
^1666470494817

Metaphase I::Paired homologues move to the metaphase plate and become oriented w/ homologues of each pair attached to opposite poles of the spindle
^1666470494824

In mitosis, homologues act independently, whereas in meiosis, there are ---::two possible arrangements at the equatorial place while lining up in metaphase I
^1666470494832

Possible num of different gametes is ---::2n where n = num of chromosomes; n = 23 in human cells, so over 8 mil passible combinations; More genetic diversity caused by different arrangement possibilities in metaphase I
^1666470494839

During anaphase I, homologues are ---::pulled to opposite poles for each pair of chromosomes; In mitosis *sister chromotids* are pulled to opposite poles
^1666470494847

Microtubules from opposite poles attach to each homologue (not each sister chromatid as in mitosis) during ---::metaphase; Homologues are aligned at metaphase plate side-by-side w/ random orientation
^1666470494854

Anaphase I::Homologues are pulled to opposite poles by shortening of microtubules; Chiasmata break w/ separation; Each pole has a complete haploid set of chromosomes consisting of one member of each homologous pair and independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes
^1666470494862

Process of chromosome alignment differs between ---::meiosis I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and homologous chromosomes arranged at midpoint of the cell in metaphase I. In anaphase I, homologous chromosomes are separated. In prometaphase II, microtubules attach to kinetochores of sister chromatids, and sister chromatids are arranged at midpoint of the cells in metaphase II. In anaphase II, sister chromatids are separated.
^1666470494870

Telophase I::Nuclear envelope reforms around each daughter nucleus; Sister chromatids no longer identical bc of crossing over in prophase I; Cytokinesis may or may not occur after telophase I; Meiosis II occurs after interval of variable length
^1666470494876

Meiotic cells have an interphase period that is ---::similar to mitosis w/ G1, S, and G2 phases; After interphase, germline cells enter meiosis I; After meiosis I, cells inter Meiosis II after variable time period
^1666470494884

Meiosis II resembles ---::a mitotic division; Occurs after Meiosis I
^1666470494891

Prophase II::Nuclear envelopes dissolve and new spindle apparatus forms
^1666470494898

Metaphase II::Chromosomes align on metaphase plate
^1666470494905

Anaphase II::Sister chromatids are separated from each other
^1666470494912

Telophase II::Nuclear envelope reforms around 4 sets of daughter chromosomes; cytokinesis follows
^1666470494923

An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4) proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form ---::four haploid daughter cells.
^1666470494932

Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of DNA replication; however, meiosis includes ---::two nuclear divisions. The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the parent cell.
^1666470494940

The final result of meiosis is ---::four cells containing haploid sets of chromosomes; In animals, develop directly into gametes; Plants, fungi, and many protists divide mitotically to produce greater nums of gametes (can have adults w/ varying nums of gametes)
^1666470494961

Meiosis is characterized by 4 features::Synapsis and crossing over; Sister chromatids remain joined at their centromeres throughout meiosis I; Kinetochores of sister chromatids attach to same pole in meiosis I; DNA replication is suppressed between meiosis I and meiosis II
^1666470494969

In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the gametes gives rise to a ---::fertilized egg cell, or zygote. The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular offspring. The germ cells are generated early in the development of the zygote.
^1666470494976

Animals have --- dominant life cycles::diploid
^1666470494983

Fungi, such as black bread mold, have haploid-dominant life cycles. The haploid multicellular stage produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis to produce ---::haploid spores. Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by mitosis. 
^1666470494990

Plant life cycle alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are ---::free-living. The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis. The spores develop into multicellular, haploid plants called gametophytes because they produce gametes. The gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid zygote that becomes the sporophyte.
^1666470494997

Nondisjunction::Failure of chromosomes to move to opposite poles during either meiotic division; Supposed to go to opposite poles but may go to same pole instead
^1666470495003

Aneuploid gametes::Gametes w/ missing or extra chromosomes; Most common cause of spontaneous abortion; Gametes supposed to have one set (zygote gets main set + backup set but may have too many sets (polyploidy) or two few (aneuploid))
^1666470495010

1-22 chromosomes are autosomes and the 23rd pair are sex chromosomes. If you have a nondisjunction event of bigger chromosomes, then ---::info is in wrong amounts
^1666470495016

Trisomy 21/Down Syndrome::Extra copy of chromosome 21; Polyploidy cell; Can lead to different physical features and mental effects
^1666470495024

1. The bony fishes
	1. This clade is underneath [[Clade Gnathostome]]
	2. We are all "bony fishes" so really "bony vertebrates"
	3. Ossified bone
		1. Can be broken down by osteocytes to release calcium
2. Two main classes
	1. Class Actinopterygii
		1. The "ray finned fishes"
	2. Class Sarcopterygii
		1. The "lobe-finned fishes"
3. Shared characteristics
	1. Covered in scales
	2.  Produce mucus covering
		1. External slime
		2. Part of the immune system
		3. Reduces drag
	3. Lateral line present
	4. Gilles
	5. Gas bladder
		1. Derived from the lungs
4. Class Actinopterygii
	1. Ray-finned fishes
		1. Reduced bones
		2. Fin rays support the fins
	2. Characteristics
		1. Ganoid, cycloid, or ctenoid scales
			1. Ganoid is bone
				1. Very difficult to penetrate
			2. Cycloid
				1. smooth and flexible
			3. Ctenoid
				1. Has little projections like spikes
				2. Ex: bass
		2. Lungs -> Gas bladder
			1. GB is for buoyancy regulation 
		3. External fertilization and development
		4. Example groups
			1. Most fish diversity (38K species)
			2. Chondrostei
				1. Cartilagous bony fish
			3. Holosteans
				1. Basal fish
			4. Elopomorpha
				1. Ex: eels 
			5. Osteoglossomorphs
				1. Ex: Gold orawana 
			6. Otocephala
				1. Ex: minnows
				2. Specialized stress chemical to warn others 
				3. Can process sound through swim bladder
			7. Euteleostei
				1. Ex: catfish, piranha
5. Class Sarcopterygii
	1. Lobed-finned fishes
		1. Fleshy lobes
		2. Similar bones to tetra
	2. Characteristics
		1. Cosmoid scales
			1. Covered in cosmene (not dentine)
		2. Few living species 
		3. More extensive fossils
		4. Tetrapod ancestor
	3. Example groups
		1. Coelacanths
			1. Rediscovered group (thought to be extinct)
		2. Crossopterygians
			1. Extinct
		3. Dipnoans
			1. Lungfish
			2. Common in the Devonian
6. [[Clade Tetrapod]]
7. [[Clade Amniotes]]

The salivary glands lie on the sides of the ---::neck, between muscles and the external layer of skin. They are soft spongy tissue that secrete saliva and amylase (an enzyme that helps break down food). 
^1680739511891

There are three salivary glands in rats: ---::**sublingual (yellow pin)**, **submaxillary (green pin)**, and **parotid (red pin)**. The parotid is easiest to find, it lies just beneath the ear and extends to the neck.
^1680739511901

The **lymph glands** lie anterior to the ---::salivary glands. Lymph glands are dark and circular and are pressed against the jaw muscles.
^1680739511909

The trachea is identifiable by its ---::ringed cartilage which provides support. The esophagus lies behind the trachea.
^1680739511918

The **larynx** is just anterior to the ---::trachea. The larynx is the voicebox, and allows rats to make squeaking noises.
^1680739511927

We dissected the rat from the --- side::ventral (belly); This means left is right and right is left.
^1680739511936

The **diaphragm** and the **heart** is centrally located in the ---::thoracic cavity. The **thymus gland**, may be visible at the upper part of the heart.
^1680739511944

The **lungs** are spongy organs that lie on either side of the ---::heart and should take up most of the thoracic cavity. They lie closer to the back of the rat, you will need to push the ribs to the side to find them.
^1680739511953

The **liver**, which is a dark colored organ suspended just under the ---::diaphragm. It has four lobes.
^1680739560049

The stomach is a curved organ lying just under the ---::liver. At the top of the stomach you can see the **esophagus** where it pierces the diaphragm and joins the stomach. Lifting the stomach up may reveal a bumpy glandular organ: the pancreas.
^1680739511971

The **spleen** is about the same color as the liver and is attached to the ---::greater curvature of the stomach.
^1680739511980

The **small intestine** is a slender coiled tube that receives partially digested food from the stomach (via the pyloric sphincter). It consists of three sections: ---::**duodenum**, **jejunum** and  **ileum**, (Listed in order from the stomach to the large intestine.) 
^1680739511987

Locate the **colon**, which is the large tube that extends from the small intestine and leads to the anus. The colon is also known as the **large intestine** and it consists of four sections: ---::> **cecum** - large flattened sac in the lower third of the abdominal cavity, it is a dead-end pouch and is similar to the appendix in humans.  
^1680739511997

The primary organs of the excretory system are the ---::**kidneys**. These organs are large bean shaped structures located toward the back of the abdominal cavity on either side of the spine.
^1680739512005

The delicate ureters that attach to the kidney and lead to the ---::**bladder**. Wiggle the kidneys to help locate these tiny tubes.
^1680739512012

Areas of the kidney: ---::the **cortex** (the outer area) and the **medulla** (the inner area).
^1680739512020

The **urethra** carries urine from the bladder to the ---::urethral orifice.
^1680739512027

The small yellowish glands embedded in the fat atop the kidneys are the ---::**adrenal glands.**

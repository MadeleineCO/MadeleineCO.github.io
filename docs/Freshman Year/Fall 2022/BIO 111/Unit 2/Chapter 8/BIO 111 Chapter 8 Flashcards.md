Photosynthesis (bio)::	$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$; Energy for all life ultimately comes from this anabolic reaction; Stores energy
^1664053311085

Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs in the presence of ---::oxygen; Ex cyanobacteria and algae
^1664053223210

Chemoautotrophs::Deep ocean autotrophs that do not have access to sunlight and generate energy from other sources
^1664053223220

Heterotrophs::Herbivores eat plants and metabolize energy created and stored from photosynthesis (Must eat a lot of plants because relatively low energy); Carnivores eat other [[Organism|organisms]] (Don't need to eat on the scale of herbivores bc their prey contains much higher energy than plants); Omnivores eat animal and highly digestible plant matter
^1664053223227

Plant vascular tissue::Used for transportation; Xylem brings water up from roots and phloem brings sugar down to roots
^1664053223234

Wavelength::The distance between a crest and a crest or a trough and a trough
^1664297737708

Electromagnetic spectrum::Visible light = 400-700 nanometers and is a small part of this spectrum; Shorter wavelengths have more energy and longer wavelengths have less energy (violet = highest and red = lowest in visible light range)
^1664297737715

A photon will either be ---::absorbed or reflected; Ex: chlorophyll that appears green absorbs all colors *but* green
^1664297737728

^1664297737758

 In deciduous trees, chlorophyll breaks down in ---::leaves first and leaves turn to red or orange. Then carotenoids like xanthophyll degrade and leaf turns brown and dies
^1664297737764

Structure of chlorophyll::Porphyrin ring; Complex ring structure w/ alternating double and single bonds; Magnesium ion at the center of the ring; Hydrocarbon tail (hydrophobic); Photons excite electrons in the ring then electrons are shuttled away from the ring
^1664297737769

Chlorophyll a::Main pigment in plants and cyanobacteria; Only pigment that can act directly to convert light energy to chemical energy; Absorbs violet-blue and red light
^1664297737775

Oxygenic photosynthesis::Two photosystems that carry out noncyclic transfer of electrons used to generate both ATP and NADPH; Photosystem I (P700) functions like sulfur bacteria; Photosystem II (P680) can generate an oxidation potential high enough to oxidize water 
^1664411406082

A photosystem consists of a ---::light-harvesting complex and a reaction center. Pigments in the light-harvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center. (Photosystem II (P680))
^1664411406091

After passing to the reaction center in Photosystem II (P680) light excites an electron from the ---::chlorophyll a pair, which passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then be replaced.
^1664411406100

In photosystem II (P680), the electron comes from the ---::splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product. In photosystem I (P700), the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain
^1664411406110

Photosystem II::Resembles reaction center of purple bacteria; Core of 10 transmembrane protein subunits w/ electron transfer components and two P680 chlorophyll molecules; Reaction center differs from purple bacteria in that it also contains 4 Mn (Essential for oxidation of H2O); B6-f complex is proton pump embedded in thylakoid membrane
^1664411406119

1st part of photosynthesis chain (light-dependent stages)::Photosystem II --> B6-f complex --> Photosystem I
^1664411406126

B6-f complex::Proton pump embedded in thylakoid membrane; Pumps H+ ions from the splitting of water in Photosystem II to create gradient
^1664411406134

Every time electrons transfer to different complex, they ---::lose a bit of energy
^1664411406142

Photosystem I::Reaction center consists of a core transmembrane complex consisting of 12-14 protein subunits w/ two bound P700 chlorophyll molecules; Accepts an electron from plastocyanin into the "hole" created by exit of a light-energized electron; Passes electrons to NADP+ to form NADPH
^1664411406150

Photosystem Organization::Antenna complex w/ hundreds of accessory pigment molecules (Gather photons and feed the captured light energy to the reaction center); Reaction center w/ 1 or more chlorophyll a molecules (Passes excited electrons out of the photosystem)
^1664411406159

In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight extracts ---::electrons from water. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (Reduces NADP+ to NADPH). Then goes to ETC
^1664411406169

The ETC moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the ---::lumen in photosystem II. At the same time, splitting water adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the stroma. Net result is low pH in the thylakoid lumen (high pH in the stroma); ATP] synthase uses this electrochemical gradient to make ATP
^1664411406178

Antenna Complex::Also called light-harvesting complex; Captures photons from sunlight and channels them to the reaction center chlorophylls
^1664411406186

In chloroplasts, light-harvesting complexes such as the antenna complex consist of a web of ---::chlorophyll molecules linked together and held tightly in the thylakoid membrane by a matrix of proteins
^1664411406195

Reaction Center::Transmembrane protein–pigment complex; When a chlorophyll in the reaction center absorbs a photon of light, an electron is excited to a higher energy level, which can be transferred to the primary electron acceptor and reduced; Oxidized chlorophyll then fills its electron “hole” by oxidizing a donor molecule
^1664411406204

Light dependent reaction summary::Primary photoevent (photon is captured by a pigment); Charge separation (energy transferred to reaction center and excited electron transferred to acceptor molecule); Electron transport (electrons move through carriers to reduce NADP+); Chemiosmosis (ATP production)

^1664411406221

Carbon fixation::Light independent; Uses ATP and NADPH from light dependent reaction; Leaves get light and generate ATP and NADPH that are transported to tuber underground in which sugar is made and stored
^1664411406230

Cyclic Photophosphorylation::In sulfur bacteria, only one photosystem is used; Passes excited electrons to ETC to create a proton gradient for ATP synthesis; Anoxygenic photosynthesis (without oxygen)
^1664411406238

Cyclic Photosystem I and II relation::Photosystem I transfers electrons ultimately to NADP+, producing NADPH; Photosystem II oxidizes water to replace the electrons transferred to photosystem I; 2 photosystems connected by cytochrome/ b6-f complex
^1664411406246

Noncyclic phosphorylation::Plants use photosystems II and I in series to produce both ATP and NADPH (Path of electrons not a circle); Photosystems replenished with electrons obtained by splitting water
^1664411406255

Calvin cycle stage 1::Enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, 3-PGA. 
^1664411406263

Calvin cycle stage 2::The organic molecule (3-PGA) from stage 1 is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH
^1664411406270

Calvin cycle stage 3::RuBP, the molecule that starts the cycle, is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. 
^1664411406279

In the Calvin cycle, only one carbon dioxide molecule is ---::incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed 3 times to produce a single 3 C GA3P molecule, and six times to produce a 6 C glucose molecule.
^1664411406287

The 1st products of photosynthesis are ---::O2 and H+ ions; Whenever there is oxygen present, other chemicals can become oxidized and free radicals can also occur (will break down membrane); Issues prevented by palacide layer of brick-like cells w/ chloroplast on top (bottom layer has more open, spongy spaces); Allows O2 to go out through stromata openings (also allows plants to gain necessary resources like CO2); Could lose water through stromata on hot days in C3 synthesis
^1664411406297

C3 photosynthesis::Plants that fix carbon using only C3 photosynthesis (the Calvin cycle); Lose water through stromata on hot, sunny days (thrive in shadier environments)
^1664411406305

C4 photosynthesis::Spatial solution to free radical/water escape problem; Resource fixation and oxygen generation are in separate spaces; Seeds can indicate this type (monocaut or dicaut)
^1664411406313

CAM photosynthesis::Temporal solution to free radical/water escape problem; Only open stromata at night when evaporation chances are lower; Ex: cacti, pineapple
^1664411406320

C4 and CAM::•Add CO2 to PEP to form 4 carbon molecule; Use PEP carboxylase; Greater affinity for CO2, no oxidase activity; Alternatives to C3 photosynthesis and fix free radical/water escape problem two different ways

When establishing a genetic program, identify a better source if genetics is a limiting factor in ---::obtaining max production performance; Usually *not* the case
^1680743102242

When establishing a genetic program, be sure that you are using the correct ---::mating system that maximizes performance
^1680743102252

When establishing a genetic program, be sure that herd health is not ---::limiting performance; May require herd depopulation w/ healthy superior genetics (be sure to understand the costs of this choice); If relocating operations may be good time to update genetics and improve health
^1680743102261

Available Genetic Resources for Swine Selection::Genetic Supplier, Breeds or Lines, Choice of individual animals within the pop (breed or line), Selection can be at nucleus, multiplier, or commercial levels; Mating Systems 
^1680743102270

Selection of swine can be at the --- levels (available genetic resources)::nucleus (great grandparents), multiplier (grandparent), or commercial (parent)
^1680743102279

^1680743102338

There are --- traits of economic important in swine::seven; NBA, NW, SPL, LWT21, D250, F:G/G:F, BF10
^1680743102345

Four Repro traits of interest in swine::low h^2; Num born alive (NBA), Num weaned (NW), Sow longevity (SPL - like stayabilitiy in cattle), 21d litter wgt (LWT21)
^1680743102353

Two Growth traits of interest in swine::low - mod h^2; Days to 115 kg/250 lb (D250); Feed efficiency (F:G and G:F)
^1680743102361

One Carcass trait of interest in swine::high h^2; Backfat thickness (BF10)
^1680743102369

Trait Consideration and Selection::Choose traits that economically impact the operation; Consider if the trait is measurable (accurately and in repeatable fashion); Consider if trait has sufficient genetic variation
^1680743102377

Num born alive is the salable item produced by the ---::sow
^1680743102386

21d litter wgt is what a producers selling weaning pigs is ---::selling (min wgt required to obtain full value)
^1680743102394

Days to market wgt is how long the pig will stay in ---::finishing facilities and feed efficiency (daily maintenance requirements)
^1680743102402

Backfat and loin muscle depth or area determines ---::percentage lean in the carcass which is the salable product (meat) for consumption
^1680743102410

Features Necessary for selection::Equal opportunity (no preferential treatment); Systematic measurement of all animals (same means, location, etc.); Env adjustments (ex parity, season of year, etc.) NSIF adjustment factors; Use of records
^1680743102418

[[2023-04-10]]
STAGES (Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System)::National Swine Registry (NSR); For Duroc, Hampshire, Landrace, and Yorkshire (two maternal - L and Y - and two paternal - D and H); Includes F1 (ex L x Y) data to make maternal data more accurate
^1681181088964

STAGES uses a multi-trait animal model for ---::genetic selection; Also generates daily across-herd-EPDs on association computers; Considers breed specific variance components and adjustments 
^1681181088976

Postweaning Data::Pigs scanned at or near 250 lbs (most ideally set this off-test wgt at your ideal market wgt); Scan boars, gilts, and barrows every 3-4 weeks; Record wgt, backfat, and loin muscle area; Data sent to NSR then results returned to breeder 
^1681181088984

STAGES Program Components::Records of ancestry (Pedigree); Performance measurement program; EBV estimation program; Public access to genetic rankings; Indexes to combine traits that economically influence selection decisions
^1681181088991

Swine Data Procedures::Litter data recording in farrowing house (pedigree, date farrowed, NBA, num after transfer (num allowed to nurse), 21D litter wgt); Data sent to NSR
^1681181089000

Purebreeding (Swine Mating System)::Used at nucleus (GGP) level and some level at multiplication; Inbreeding (avoided), linebreeding, and outcrossing 
^1681181089007

Crossbreeding (Swine Mating System)::Used at multiplication level and commercial level; Terminal, rotational, or rotaterminal
^1681181089015

System choice of terminal, rotational, or rotaterminal for swine crossbreeding is dependent on ---::herd health, management level, cost, other
^1681181089021

Swine inbreeding system goal is to ---::maximize heterosis/hybrid vigor
^1681181089029

Why maximize heterosis through inbreeding systems?::Free (don't waste money :)); Effects fitness traits that typically influence profitability the most (conception rates, NB and NBA, longevity, etc.)
^1681181089036

When implementing a swine inbreeding mating system, make sure it is ---::implemented correctly 100% of the time
^1681181089042

Breed Complementarity (Swine)::No breed perfect for all traits; Crossbreeding allows mixing of breeds to create more ideal offspring than parent breeds; Strong points of one breed may offset weaker points of another
^1681181089050

PSE::Causes meat that is pale, soft, and exudative (PSS symptoms); Can test the Napole (RN) and the Halothane (HAL) genes 
^1681181089057

In PSE, RN is dom allele (RN-) and a recessive allele (rn+) that is --- inherited on ---::simply; one locus 
^1681181089064

RN reduces the ultimate pH of the muscle, which reduces the water-holding capacity and increases purge, especially in ---::ham and loin; Creates "acid meat" by reducing pH; PSE/PSS
^1681181089071

HAL is a mutation on chromosome ---::6 at nucleotide 1843 of the pig; Increases lean meat content but enhances PSE and PSS
^1681181089078

PSS is when animal lacks ability to ---::adapt to stress; Symptom of PSE
^1681181089085

HAL is inherited from a single ---::locus where there are two alleles (N = normal and n = mutant); HAL has three possibilities = NN (normal), Nn (carrier), or nn (mutant; stress positive)
^1681181089093

DNA probes can now identify all three genotypes of --::HAL gene for PSE/PSS in swine; 30%-50% of carriers produce inferior muscle pork quality 
^1681181089100

All poor pork quality is *not* due to ---::HAL; Only about 20% of poor pork quality was negative for HAL; Yet eliminating HAL positive pigs would drastically help pork quality issues
^1681181089107

The worst condition of PSS (genotype) is ---::homo rec for HAL and RN; Produces carcasses that are watery, chewy, and undesirable
^1681181089115

Animals w/ PSS reproduce at --- rates and often ---::lower; die before they get into breeding herd
^1681181089122

Heterozygotes for HAL and RN don't show signs but ---::carry the potential for stress (PSS)
^1681181089130

In PSS, either homozygotes or heterozygotes will cause problems either in ---::transit or at packing plant; If you have any stress genes in herd, look at them as though they are strictly terminal (yet try to stay away)
^1681181089138

Nebraska SPF claims that they were first to ---::have stress-free swine herds
^1681181089144

American Yorkshire Club first to take a stand against ---::the swine stress gene

^1681242305216

Gene Transfer::Transgenic; Producing animals that are not carrying a gene that is native; Ex: Goat + lysine = shelf-stable milk; Ex: golden rice = more VA
^1681242305223

Extent of impact of biotech in animal breeding depends on ---::effectiveness; Practicality; Cost; Public Perception (can be negative)
^1681242305230

Animal breeding is a branch of genetics, while repro is an ---::aspect of physiology; When making selection and mating decisions, made in context of available repro tech
^1681242305237

Artificial Insemination (AI)::Semen collected from males; Used fresh, cooled, or frozen to breed females; Not always easy or practical (females must be in heat and moved to breeding area; must be inseminated at right time)
^1681242305244

Benefits of AI::Can use genes of superior sire even after sire is dead; Can control what animal breeds w/ what animal; Portable (can use semen from bulls across the world)
^1681242305251

Estrus Synchronization::Hormones used to induce females to come into heat at the same time; Benefit = reduces num of days to inseminate
^1681242305258

PGF2a::Causes regression of corpus luteum and decrease in progesterone synthesis; Prostaglandin; Decrease in hormone of pregnancy
^1681242305265

^1681242305294

After around six days, the embryos transferred to ---::recips (surrogates) or frozen
^1681242305300

Pros/cons of ET::Benefit = allows females to have many more offspring than normal; Problem = Identifying candidates can be difficult (limited data)
^1681242305307

ET can cause certain problems for ---::genetic evaluation (issues w/ maternal traits as recips; usually not high quality animals); Calves may be harmed by an inferior maternal env (ex WW is a trait w/ maternal effects)
^1681242305314

ET is more costly and difficult than ---::AI; Must synchronize donor and recips if using fresh embryos
^1681242305320

ET to the female is like AI to the ---::male
^1681242305327

Graphic of ET process::![[Pasted image 20230410101810.png]]
^1681242305334

*In Vitro* Fertilization::Fertilization in a test tube; Eggs (oocytes) collected from donor female through aspiration of the repro tract; Incubated/matured & fertilized in lab; Frozen or transferred to recip
^1681242305341

^1681346793575

In IVF, eggs can be collected from young, pre-pubertal females then ---::matured, fertilized, and transferred to multiple animals so you can generate more offspring (which increases genetic data)
^1681346793580

Disadvantages of IVF::Expensive; Relatively low success rate; May cause abnormalities in offspring (genes that aren't supposed to be turned on in certain areas)
^1681346793585

[[2023-04-14]]
Sex Control::Determines the sex of embryo by physically removing a few cells and examining the chromosomes

^1681437882888

Y-specific DNA primer and PCR::Gel electrophoresis shows if there is a Y-present after duplication DNA strand using PCR and Y-specific DNA primer
^1681437882896

Primer::Sequence of nucleotides that is usually 20-22 NT long; In process of DNA replication, primer binds to strand that DNA pol will first copy
^1681437882904

PCR::Allows you to make several copies of a DNA strand
^1681437882912

Sperm Sorting::Sorts sperm cells into YX and XX; Sexed semen is more expensive and contains fewer sperm cells (sorts out females and deficients)
^1681437882918

Flow cytometry::The method used to sort sperm; Measures cells as they flow through detector based on DNA content (X contains 4% more DNA than Y)
^1681437882925

Sexing Semen Steps::1 - Semen labeled w/ fluorescent dye (Hoechst 33324)  2 - X absorbs more dye than Y (has more DNA)  3 - X glows brighter than Y under UV light  4 - Spermatozoa encased in single droplet of fluid as they pass flow cytometer in single file line  5 - Assigned an electric charge (X = pos; Y = neg)  6 - Stream of X and Y droplets separated by electrostatic deflection and collected into separate tubes 
^1681437882933

We can sort semen by ---::charge; Sample input into funnel -> Laser excitation -> High voltage deflection plates sort based on electric charge (X = more negative than Y (more DNA))
^1681437882943

Sexing Semen Graphic::![[Pasted image 20230412101753.png]]

^1681437882988

Sperm sorting was first used in the --- industry::dairy; Reduced num of bull calves drastically 
^1681437882995

Sex choice when using sexed semen depends on ---::herd genetics and marketing progress; Commercial herds want male calves from cows while seedstock herds want male calves for resale
^1681437883003

Why bother sexing semen?::One sex may be more valuable than the other (ex males = meat and females = milk); Better economics (if sire strong for maternal traits, use him to produce female offspring; Crossbreeding systems
^1681437883010

When cloning, we need to cross clonal lines to avoid ---::inbreeding depression 
^1681437883070

Benefits of Cloning::Jump in *genetic merit* (one generation = genetically elite animals); Increases *uniformity* of performance (any variation is due to env); Increases *accuracy* of selection
^1681437883078

The higher the h^2, the more --- the pop for that trait::uniform
^1681437883084

By virtue of large amounts of performance data for each clonal line, --- of selection is improved::accuracy
^1681437883091

^1681595469164

Cloned animals --- rapidly::age; Telomeres on chromosomes unravel; Telomeres = specialized terminal structures on chromosomes that ensure the maintenance and accuracy of replication (like protective caps)
^1681595469173

Could we cloning on animals that have proven genetic worth?::Yes, but performance differences may arise from env variation 
^1681595469181

1. Most enzymes are [[protein|proteins]]
	1. Some are RNA
2. Shape of enzyme stabilizes a temporary association between substrates
3. Enzyme not changed or consumed in reaction
4. Carbonic anhydrase
	1. Enzymes often end in "ase"
	2. 200 molecules of carbonic acid per hr made without enzyme
	3. 600,000 molecules formed per second w/ enzyme
5. Speed up reactions by lowering activation [[energy]] as catalysts ([[Metabolism]])
6. Enzymes have tertiary structure bc they are proteins
	1. Active site = where the molecule of interest (ligend) binds 
		- Like a glove for a baseball
		- Pockets or clefts for substrate binding
		- Precise fit of substrate into active site
		- ---
7. Do not change the free [[energy]] or the reaction, just lower the activation energy
8. According to induced-fit model, both enzyme and substrate undergo dynamic conformational changes upon binding. The enzyme contorts the substrate into its transition state, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction
	1. Substrate enters active site of enzyme, enzyme changes shape slightly as substrate binds (enzyme/substrate complex), enzyme/products complex, products leave the active site of enzyme
	2. The bond is bent by the enzyme, which stresses the bond and makes it break more quickly
		- Stresses it but enzyme does not actually break it
	3. Occur on microsecond scales
9. Can control how an enzyme works
	1. To inhibit effect, can block the active site pocket (like plugging it so it cannot work)
		- Competitive inhibitor competes for the same binding site thus inhibiting enzyme function
	2. Allosteric site can regulate access
		- Some active sites need something to make active site open or work
			- Allosteric activation modifies the active site so that the affinity for substrate increases
		- Noncompetitive allosteric inhibitor can change the shape of the active site so it cannot bind
			- Indirectly modifies active site so substrate binding is reduced or prevented
10. Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes
	1. Required for enzymes to function properly
	2. More oxygens are more water-soluble and have more polarity
	3. More aromatic ring structures without many hydroxyl groups are more nonpolar
	4. Vitamin D
		- Lots of hydrogen and carbons
		- Nonpolar
	5. B vitamins
		- Lots of hydroxyl groups and oxygens
		- [[Water]]-soluble
		- Polar
	6. Vitamin C
		- [[Water]]-soluble
		- Has oxygens
	7. Vitamin E
		- Fat-soluble
		- Hydrogens and carbons, not oxygens
	8. [[Water]] soluble vitamins cannot be stored and are released in urine
	9. [[Lipid]] soluble vitamins can be stored
11. Metabolic pathways ([[Metabolism]])
	1. Series of chemical reactions converting things
		- Ex: Cholesterol to vitamin D
	2. The end product can often stop the entire biochemical reaction from working
		- If you have plenty of vitamin D, you don't need to make more
		- If you don't have enough end product, can make more

1. Outbreeding = Mating of individuals that are *less closely related* genetically than the avg of the pop
	 1. Increase in heterozygosity
	 2. Results in hybrid vigor or heterosis
		 1. The superior performance of crossbred offspring
	 3. Used in commercial meat animal production
	 4. We cross animals bc they have different characteristics
		 1. Sometimes, we cross species
 2. Within Breed
	 1. Crossing inbred lines
		 1. Still results in heterosis, but not as dramatic as when you cross outside of the breed
		 2. Crossing animals of different families within the same breed
	 2. Poultry industry
		 1. Several strains/lines of one breed
		 2. Within each line, intense selection for economically important traits
		 3. Over time, the animals become genetically distinct
		 4. Ex: A, B, C, and D represent four different lines/strains
			 1. Cross A w/ B and C w/ D
				 1. A x B offspring are 50% A and 50% B
				 2. C x D offspring are 50% C and 50% D
			 2. Cross AB w/ CD
				 1. Offspring are then line ABCD (25% each)
				 2. ABCD becomes the commercial line (the line that is sold)
 3. Grading Up (AKA Topcrossing)
	 1. Mating purebred males that are superior to non-purebred females (grade)
	 2. Attempt to create a purebred population 
	 3. Ex: Angus male and Brangus female
		 1. Angus is purebred Angus
		 2. Brangus as Brahman x Angus
			 1. Has a 5/8 3/8 genetic ratio of brahman to angus 
		 3. Lets say the Angus male is 100% angus and the Brangus female is 50% A and 50% B
			 1. The offspring of this cross is 75% A and 25% B
			 2. One step towards a purebred Angus 
		 4. Then you cross 100% Angus w/ the 75:25 offspring
			 1. Results in offspring that is 87.5% A and 12.5% B
		 5. Then cross 100% Angus w/ 87.5:12.5 offspring
			 1. Results in 93.75% A and 6.35% B offspring
 4. Crossbreeding = the crossing of different breeds
	 1. Ex: Duroc male x Landrace female
		 1. Duroc swine has a problem w/ fat
		 2. Landrace swine has good maternal qualities
		 3. You can combine the traits of Duroc w/ the traits of Landrace
 5. Species crosses
	 1. Closely related species can be mixed
	 1. Ex: Horse (64 chromosomes) x Donkey (62 chromosomes) = mule (63 chromosomes)
		 1. Can't mate bc chromosomes can't pair normally at meiosis
	 2. Ex: Domestic cattle x American bison
		 1. Creates "beefalo"
	 3. Ex: Bos taurus (of European ancestry) x Bos indicus
		 1. Important for beef production in the Southern US
		 3. Such as Angus (European) x Brahman (Indian)
			 1. Creates Brangus
			 2. Combines growth rate, carcass attributes of Angus, w/ hardiness and adaptability to hot, humid conditions of Brahman 
 6. Effects of Outbreeding
	 1. Does not eliminate deleterious recessive alleles
		 1. Perpetuates them by masking their expression
	 2. Phenotypic effects = heterosis or hybrid vigor
		 1. Opposite of inbreeding depression
		 2. Heterosis definition = The superiority, for many traits, of the offspring from outbred matings, in comparison to the avg phenotypic merit of offspring from random matings within the pop contributing to the cross
		 3. Superiority of the crossbred to the purebred parents in many traits overall
			 1. Observed heterosis is the net effect of such influences at all loci affecting the trait
				 1. The net effect is better
		 4. The degree of superiority of the outbred offspring for a particular trait as compared to the avg of the parental line or breed
		 5. Heterosis is the difference between the avg of all crossbreds, in comparison to the avg of all purebreds contributing to those crosses
			 1. % heterosis = (mean of F1 offspring - mean of parent breeds)/mean of parent breeds  x 100
	 3. Ex: 150 day calf weight
		 1. ![[Pasted image 20230224104141.png]]
			 1. Angus purebred avg = 336
			 2. Hereford purebred avg = 334
			 3. Angus (dam) x Hereford (sire) avg = 372
			 4. Hereford (dam) x Angus (sire) = 366
			 5. 34 lb. difference between the avg of the crossbreeds and purebreds
				 1. (366 + 372)/2 = 369 (avg of crossbreeds)
				 2. (336 + 334)/2 = 335 (avg of purebreds)
				 3. (369 - 335)/335 = 10% difference between crosbreeds and parent breeds
				 4. 369 - 335 = 34
			 6. In this example, crossbreds are superior not only to the avg of the straightbreds contributing to the cross, they also are superior to the more productive of the two straightbred groups
	 4. If crossbreeding is the mating system of choice, this should be the case for overall efficiency of production 
		 1. Sometimes, however, it is not
			 1. Ex: Dairy cattle production in the US
				 1. No breed, when crossed w/ Holstein, will produce F1 generation crossbred cow whose fluid milk yield exceeds that of straightbred Holsteins
				 2. Although crossbred cows do produce more milk than the avg of straightbreds contributing to the cross
					 1. H x H (7000 kg) 
					 2. J x J (5000 kg)
					 3. Average purebreds (6000 kg)
					 4. H x J (6300 kg)
				 3. With increase in milk production, fertility declines
	 5. Meat Animal Production
		 1. Crossbreeding used by most commercial produces (beef cattle, sheep, hogs)
		 2. Often, crossbreds will not exceed the better purebred parent for individual traits such as survival, growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass merit
		 3. However, heterosis for all traits contributing to overall production efficiency will cumulate and result in crossbreds w/ greater net economic merit than the best avg straightbred
	 6. Breed complementation
		 1. Combining the desirable characteristics (traits) of two or more breeds (or lines) into the same offspring
			 1. Ex: Brangus 
		 2. One breed in a cross can be chosen partially to compensate for deficiencies of another breed
	 7. Ex: Commercial beef cattle producers in VA
		 1. Maintain herd of Angus (or Angus crossbred cows)
		 2. Angus characteristics
			 1. Moderate mature size
			 2. Good fertility
			 3. Reach puberty by one year to 15 months 
				 1. Easy to have first calf by two years old
			 5. Muscle is more highly marbled after a standard time on feed vs other breeds
				 1. Marbling, or intramuscular fat, is necessary for carcass to grade choice under USDA grading standards
				 2. Genetic potential for marbling is important in establishing market value of feeder cattle
			 6. Females have very good maternal characteristics
				 1. Good weaning weight
				 2. Milk production is somewhat higher than Hereford
			 7. Calves of Angus ancestry sell for higher prices than calves without evidence of Angus ancestry
			 8. Sire breeds compliment Angus
				 1. Choose sires that will increase growth size and muscling of crossbred calves
				 2. Many producers use Charolais or Simmental
					 1. So breed complementation and heterosis both contribute to efficiency in herd
	 8. The degree of heterosis and complimentary depends on. . .
		 1. Genetic relationship of parents
			 1. Less closely related = greater heterosis
				 1. More dissimilar 
				 2. Ex: B. taurus x B. indicus tend to be superior to B. taurus x B. taurus
					 1. Angus is bos taurus while brahman is bos indicus
						 1. A x B offspring experience more heterosis
					 2. Bos indicus breeds have humps and extended dewlaps
				 3. Ex: crossing highly inbred lines of two breeds of swine express greater heterosis than non-inbred lines of the same breed
		 2. Trait - h^2 ability to measure trait
			 1. Heritability measures the strength of the relationship between performance (phenotypic values) and BV (genotypic) for a trait in a pop
				 1. Less than 0.2, lowly heritable
				 2. Between 0.21-0.4 - moderately heritable
				 3. Greater than 0.41 - highly heritable
			 2. If a trait is highly heritable, heterosis is low
				 1. If traits is lowly heritable, greater heterosis
			 3. Fertility and Repro traits are lowly heritable so experience more heterosis
				 1. Respond more to crossbreeding
			 4. Growth traits are moderately to highly heritable, so less heterosis
			 5. ![[Pasted image 20230301102839.png]]
			 6. Selection works well w/ traits that are highly heritable
			 7. Outbreeding takes advantage of heterosis and complimentary in lowly heritable traits
 7. Major Uses of Outbreeding in Livestock Industry
	 1. In general, maximum (optimum) production of offspring in meat spp
	 2. In commercial cow/calf operations, almost all commercial cows are crossbred 
		 1. Black Baldy = H x A
			 1. Common beef animal in the US
	 3. Swine
		 1. Extensive crossing of inbred lines and breeds to maximize repro and growth (maternal lines)
	 4. Reciprocal Recurrent Selection
		 1. System of selection for increasing the combining ability of two or more lines (or breeds) that have demonstrated from past crosses that they combine well
		 2. Development of superior inbred lines
			 1. Crossing more genetically diverse lines of two breeds = superior stock
		 3. General Combining Ability (GCA)
			 1. Refers to the performance of a breed for a particular trait in a series of crosses 
			 2. Ex: GCA for Angus when looking at weaning weight
				 1. Angus x Brahman
				 2. Angus x Hereford
				 3. Angus x Limousin
				 4. Angus x Beefmaster
				 5. List weaning wgt data for multiple crosses to determine GCA of Angus
		 4. Specific Combining Ability (SCA)
			 1. Looks at a specific cross to determine the performance of a breed for a particular tarit
			 2. Ex: SCA for Angus x Hereford when looking at weaning weight
	 5. Parents of best performing offspring are selected for next generation
		 1. Net result
			 1. Development of genetically diverse inbred lines
			 2. Better performing crossed lines that express greater heterosis
			 3. Inbred lines can then be crossed w/ inbred lines of other breeds
	 6. Poultry
		 1. Meat breeds use crossbreeding for growth advantages
		 2. Ex: white cornish male x white plymouth rock female
			 1. WCM has good growth and meat characteristics
			 2. WPR has good maternal characteristics 
	 7. Sheep
		 1. Meat breeds (down breeds like Suffolk and Hampshire)
		 2. Ex: Rambouillet ewes x Suffolk or Hampshire rams
			 1. Rambouillet
				 1. Can breed in summer
				 2. Fits env
				 3. Winter lambing
			 2. S or H rams
				 1. Good growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass merit
			 3. Prices favorable in spring, when winter lambs ready for market
			 4. Choice of Rambouillet ewe is dictated by demands of env
	 8. Dairy
		 1. Outcrossing within breeds but rarely between breeds
		 2. Reasons:
			 1. Economics - we have established very specific parameters for value of product
				 1. Developed breeds for specific purpose and market
				 2. Ex: Holstein has high milk prod and low fat while Jersey has low milk prod but high fat
					 1. Milk traits show moderate heterosis
					 2. Advantages of crossing includes. . .
						 1. Hybrid vigor increases fertility and health/survivability
						 2. Reduces inbreeding
						 3. Breed complementation 
					 3. Disadvantage of crossing is that it may negatively affect milk production or fat w/ regard to the market
	 9. Poultry
		 1. Extensive line crossing w/ laying hens
			 1. Crossing egg layer by broiler won't meet either objective
				 1. Doesn't improve milk or egg production
	 10. Wool breeds of sheep
		 1. Little advantage in crossbreeding
			 1. Little response to heterosis
			 2. Heritability of most wool traits is mod to high
 8. Systems of Crossbreeding
	 1. Define objectives
		 1. Traits of interest?
		 2. What level of heterosis is expected in traits of interest?
		 3. What level of complimentary is achievable?
	 2. Breeds
		 1. Compatibility of breeds?
		 2. Availability of quality (superior) animals?
		 3. Continuous supply of animals?
			 1. Need source of replacements
	 3. Herd Size
		 1. The larger, the better the results
			 1. Larger herds are involve more complex operations
		 2. Implementation cost vs expected return
			 1. If you are making money w/ current system, why change?
		 3. Nothing is free
			 1. Increased performance will require greater availability of feed/nutrients
	 4. Does performance of reciprocal crosses make any difference?
		 1. Env and maternal vs paternal breed
		 2. Beef cattle in desert area
			 1. Male H x female B vs Male B x female H
			 2. H x H = poor performance (straight cross)
			 3. B x B = similar to male B x female H
		 3. Look at mothering ability (milk production)
			 1. Determining which breed has better maternal characteristics can help you make a decision about whether to use male or female
		 4. Ex: Swine
			 1. Maternal breeds = Yorkshire, Landrace, Chester White
			 2. Paternal breeds = Duroc, Hampshire, Spots
	 5. Crossbred animals are more expensive

1. How do we get energy from [[Protein]]?
	- From Krebs cycle ([[Aerobic Respiration]])
		1. Amino acids contain a central (alpha) carbon w/ an amino group attached and a carboxyl group and a hydrogen and an R group (ex: hydrogen)
			- Deaminate this molecule
				1. Removal of amino group
				2. Contains 2 carbons
		2. If you deaminate other [[Amino Acids]], you could get two, three, four, etc. carbons
		3. In Krebs cycle, the majority of CO2 is generated
			- NADH is also created and stored
			- FADH is another nucleotide that is made in the cycle
2. [[Amino Acids]] undergo deamination to remove the amino group
	- Remainder of [[Amino Acids]] is converted to a molecule that enters glycolysis or Krebs cycle
		1. Alanine is converted to pyruvate
		2. Aspartate is converted to oxaloacetate
	- If you remove amino acids groups, you are left with n number of carbons
		1. How you get [[Energy]] from [[Protein]]
3. Nitrogenous waste
	- Most toxic form is ammonia
	- 2nd most toxic is uric acid
		1. In birds and reptiles
	- 3rd is urine
4. Krebs Cycle
	- Where most of CO2 is made
	- See chart of steps

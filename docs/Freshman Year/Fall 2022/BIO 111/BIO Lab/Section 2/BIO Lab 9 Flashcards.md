Rule of multiplication (bioll)::The probability that independent events will occur simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.

Rule of addition (bioll)::The probability that an event can occur in two or more independent ways is the sum of the probabilities of the different ways

Monohybrid cross (biol)::Cross involving one character; ex Bb x Bb
^1667433190770

lf pole bean plants (B) are dominant to bush beans (b), what are the expected genotypes and phenotypes when two heterozygous individuals are mated?::Female gamete possibilities = B and b; Male gamete possibilities = B and b; Genotype ratio: 1 BB: 2Bb: 1bb; Phenotype ratio: 3 pole: 1 bush

Test cross (biol)::Organism with dominant phenotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive
^1667433190783

lf the genotype of a pole bean plant is in doubt (i.e., Bf ), it is crossed with a bush bean plant (bb). If ? is dom (B) the cross is BB x bb and all the offspring are ---::pole beans (BB x bb; genotype ratio = All Bb; phenotype ratio = All pole); If ? is rec (b), half the offspring are pole beans and half are bush beans (Bb x bb; g ratio = 1 Bb:1 bb; p ratio = 1 pole:1 bush)

Dihybrid cross::Cross involving two characters; ex RrBb
^1667433190794

Plants heterozygous for red pole beans were crossed with each other. The genes for color (R = red, r = white) and shape (B = pole, b = bush) are on different chromosomes. Ratios for RrBb x RrBb cross?::Possible male and female gametes = RB, Rb, rB, rb; A 4 x 4 punnett square reveals that the phenotypic ratio is 9 dom, dom:3 dom, rec:3 rec, dom:1 rec rec

Sickle cell disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the DNA sequence that codes for the ---::beta chain of the hemoglobin protein; Mutation causes an amino acid substitution, replacing glutamic acid with valine. Due to this change in amino acid sequence, the hemoglobin tends to precipitate (or clump together) within the RBC after releasing its oxygen, causing an abnormal “sickled” RBC shape. 
^1667433190805

Individuals who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin allele (HBA) receive a --- hemoglobin allele from each parent and are designated ---::normal; AA; People who are homozygous for normal hemoglobin do not have any sickled RBCs. 
^1667433190809

Individuals who receive one normal hemoglobin allele from one parent and one mutant hemoglobin, or sickle cell allele (HBS), from the other parent are --- and are said to have ---::heterozygous; sickle cell trait; Their genotype is AS. Heterozygous individuals produce both normal and mutant hemoglobin proteins. Hetero individuals do not have sickle cell disease, and most of their RBCs are normal. 
^1667433190813

Hetero individuals do manifest some sickling of their RBCs in ---::low-oxygen environments. 
^1667433190817

People with sickle cell disease are --- for the sickle cell allele (SS genotype); they have received one copy of the mutant hemoglobin allele from each parent::homozygous; The resulting abnormal, sickle-shaped RBCs in these people block blood flow in blood vessels, causing pain, serious infections, and organ damage.

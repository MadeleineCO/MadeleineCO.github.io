1. Bilateral Symmetry
	1. Planes of symmetry
		1. Midsagittal
			1. Down the middle
		2. Traverse
			1. Cross-section of the body
		3. Coronal (Frontal)
			1. Cut down the side
	2. Directional terms
		1. Cranial (Anterior)
			1. Towards head
		2. Caudal (Posterior)
			1. Towards feet (or tail)
		3. Dorsal and Ventral
			1. Back vs Belly
		4. Medial and Lateral
			1. ---
		5. Proximal and Distal
			1. Towards body vs towards extremities
		6. Superior and Inferior
			1. Above vs below
		7. Center of mass
			1. CG
			2. Balancing point
			3. Gravity, inertia, vestibular system, etc. all relates to the CG
2. Size and Growth
	1. Diffusion
		1. Removing salt costs ATP
			1. H2O regulation is free
			2. ATP pump vs osmosis
		2. SA to Volume ratio in cells 
			1. Volume increases at a faster rate than SA
			2. Cells have to be fairly small to allow diffusion 
			3. Cells have such high SA relative to their volume that they can readily diffuse
			4. The bigger the cell, the more specialized pieces you need to allow function
				1. Loses ability for things to get to the center of the cell just by diffusion
			5. Diffusion distance is linked w/ cell size
		3. Solute difference
	2. Animals and Temperature
		1. Ectotherm
			1. Body temp fluctuates w/ env temp
				1. Body temp tends to track w/ outside temp
			2. Most fishes, reptiles, and amphibians
		2. Endotherm
			1. Stable internal body temp
			2. Body temp does not relate to env temp within the thermal neutral zone
				1. TNZ is range of env temps in which body can regulate its temperature
				2. No metabolic rate change within the range
					1. 4-chambered heart helps us w/ regulation
			3. Too high body temps = hyperthermia while too low body temps = hypothermia
				1. Body can no longer account for extreme env temps
			4. At low end, we increase metabolic rate while at high end, we decrease metabolic rate
				1. Harder to account for high temps 
		3. Behavioral and Physiological
			1. Lizards can shunt blood to specific areas of the body
				1. May also burrow when its hot
			2. Conservation 
				1. Curling up to conserve heat
				2. Spreading out allows more heat to be released
	3. Metabolic Rate
		1. Related to O2 and aerobic respiration
			1. We need O2 to make ATP
			2. Rate of O2 consumption 
				1. More oxygen = more metabolically active
				2. Animal at rest needs less oxygen
		2. Standard (ectothermic)
			1. Standard metabolic rate
			2. Must know specific temp
			3. Describes animal at rest if ectothermic
			4. Must account for mass
		3. Basal (endothermic)
			1. Basal metabolic rate
			2. Describes animal at rest if endothermic
			3. Must account for mass 
		4. Small organisms have higher metabolic rate than larger animals 
		5. Decreased temp results in increased metabolic rate
			1. Small animals need more O2
		6. Metabolic adjustments
			1. For every 10 degrees C, metabolic rate changes by 2x
				1. Called Q10 rule
				2. If it doesn't, organism has some sort of physiological regulation 
					1. More advantageous 
			2. Hibernation (cold)
				1. Ex: bears, some chickmunks, ground squirrels 
				2. Pack on fat to prepare for cold winter
				3. Endothermic animal significantly lowers metabolic rate during cold temps for months 
					1. Lowered respiration
					2. Lowered heart rate
					3. Conserves energy
			3. Torpor (warm)
				1. Drops metabolic rate in the short term
				2. Response to a really hot day
				3. Endothermic animal goes into shade and decreases MR to get through a hot afternoon
			4. Estivation (warm/dry)
				1. Ectothermic metabolic adjustment 
				2. Can be very long term
				3. Digs burrow, creates mucus cocoon, and can stay in state for 10 years
				4. Can induce this in a lab
			5. Brummation (cold)
				1. Reptiles, especially snakes, can do this as well as some fish
					1. Far fewer organisms are known to do this
				2. Long term mechanism in which ectothermic organism decreases activity
				3. Opposite of estivation
3. Body Cavities
	1. True coelom derived from mesoderm
		1. Completely lined by mesoderm
	2. Ventral cavities (on the belly side of the vertebral column)
		1. Thoracic (anything above the diaphragm)
			1. Contains lungs and heart
			2. Plora covers the lungs
		2. Diaphragm (in between thoracic and abdominal)
		3. Adnominal (anything below the diaphragm)
			1. Most of DS
			2. Spleen and Liver
		4. Pelvic (below the adnominal )
			1. Some large intestine and Rectum
			2. Bladder and Repro
	3. Dorsal cavities
		1. Cranial cavity
			1. Holds the brain
		2. Vertebral canal
			1. Holds spinal chord
		3. Completely closed and sterile (devoid of foreign bodies)
			1. No immune system response inside these cavities

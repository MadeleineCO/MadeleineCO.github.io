1. Herbivores that are not [[ruminant|ruminants]]
	1. True [[Monogastric]] but have significant microbial fermentation (digestion ability)
		- "One way system"
			- Do not chew cud like [[ruminant|ruminants]]
2. Digestive track ([[Digestive Anatomy and Physiology]])
	1. Mouth (mechanical digestion)
	2. Esophagus (transport)
	3. Stomach (chemical digestion)
		1. Very small compared to [[ruminant|ruminants]]
	4. Small intestines (proximal = digestion/absorption, distal = absorption)
		1. Long compared to [[omnivores]]/[[carnivores]]
		2. Need more absorption/microbial digestion time
	5. Cecum (enlarged, microbial digestion)
		1. Fermentation
		2. VFA (Energy source, 40-100%, Varies widely based on access) and B-vit
	6. Large intestines (colon; some microbial digestion; water metabolism)
3. Ex: [[Horse (Equine)]], rabbits, pandas, koalas, elephant
4. Coprophagy
	1. Eating feces
	2. Common for non-ruminant [[herbivores]] bc they can get necessary microbes
	3. Rarely a sign of nutritional issues
5. [[Horse (Equine)]] vs [[Cattle (Bovine)]]
	1. Digestive capacity: 80 vs 35 gals
	2. Organization: forestomach vs hindgut
	3. Rate of passage: 70-90 hours vs 35-50
	4. None is necessarily efficient over the other
		- Different for different environments
		- Ex: Horses better at running

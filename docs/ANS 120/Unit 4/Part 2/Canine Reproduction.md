1. [[Canine Anatomy and Physiology]]
	- [[Female Reproduction]]
2. Dogs evolved from monoestrous to diestrous
	- Most wild [[Dog (Canine)|canids]] are monoestrous (ex wolves)
		1. One estrus cycle per year
	- Domesticated dogs usually have two
		1. 4-8 month intervals (most show cycles spring/fall)
			- Average = 6 months
		2. 4-5 month period of anestrus, then proestrus, estrus, and diestrus
			- Rise and fall of estrogen levels
			- 4 months of anestrus w/ limited activity in ovaries
				1. Limited endocrine (hormones) or exocrine (ovum development) functions
			- Follicular phase includes proestrus and estrus
				1. Increase in follicle development and hormone levels (primarily estrogen and testosterone)
				2. Estrus = period of receptivity to be bred by male; about 9 days 
				3. Ovulation occurs near end of estrus
			- Luteal phase includes diestrus (2 months long)
				1. Development of corpus luteum and progesterone (hormone of pregnancy)
			- In cows, if animal does not get pregnant, starts over again
				1. If animal gets pregnant, maintain progesterone levels until about parturition
				2. Day 285 - progesterone decreases and parturition occurs
			- In dogs, luteal phase is about 2 months long regardless of if they are pregnant or not
				1. Produces P4 for same amount of time regardless
	- Difference between wolves and dogs is length of anestrous
		1. In wolves, about ---
		2. In dogs, about 4 months
3. Estimated number of animals euthanized in the USA
	- 4 to 6 million per year
		1. 13,698.63 each day
	- Other possible uses of dogs?
		1. Meat is meat so food
			- Good nutrients
			- Many countries still eat dogs
			- Mexico, Native Americans, Asian cultures, etc.
			- About 10.73 lean meat per animal
				1. 146,979.5 lbs per day that we are losing
			- 7 states have outlawed the slaughter of cats and dogs for human consumption 
4. Enhancing reproduction and breeding
	- Estimated 350-400 breeds
	- We have propagated genetic disorders through reproduction
		1. Hundreds of disease that we have propagated
			- We fail to select against these genetic problems
	- Coat color and hearing
		1. Gene linkage = when genes of different traits tend to move together in gametes
			- Gametes = haploid (1n)
		2. Coat color does *not* cause hearing loss or vise versa, but they tend to show up together in offspring 
		3. Dalmatians, White, Piebald, Roan (can be red/white)
			- 20% of all dalmatians are deaf in one ear and 8% in both
			- In blue-eyed dalmatians, about 50% are deaf
			- In white bull terriers, 1% of brown ones are deaf but 20% of white ones are deaf

1. See [[Animal Breeding]] for a brief definition of genetics
2. Mid 1800's Genetic Discoveries
	1. Three major events in the mid-1800's led directly to development of modern genetics
	2. 1859: Charles Darwin publishes *The Origin of Species*, which describes the theory of evolution by natural selection
		1. This theory requires heredity to work
	3. 1866: Gregor Mendel publishes *Experiments in Plant Hybridization*, which lays out the basic theory of genetics
		1. Vastly ignored until 1900
		2. Mendel's laws
			1. Law of Segregation
				1. Dominance vs recessiveness
			2. Law of Independent Assortment
				1. Monohybrid inheritance vs dihybrid inheritance
				2. Specific traits such as color of peas, wrinkled vs smooth, etc.
	4. 1871: Fredrich Miescher isolates "nucleic acid" from pus cells
		1. Called nucleic acid "nuclein"
3. Major Events in the 20th Century
	1. 1900: Rediscovery of Mendel's work by Robert Correns, Hugo de Vries, and Erich von Tschermak
	2. 1902: Archibald Garrod discovers that alkaptonuria, a human disease, has a genetic base
		1. Determined it was not a bacterial infection
		2. Caused by mutation that limits ability to break down tyrosine and phenylalanine
	3. 1904: Gregory Bateson discovers linkage between genes
		1. Also coins the word "genetics"
		2. Linked genes are always associated
	4. 1910: Thomas Hunt Morgan proves that genes are located on the chromosomes (using Drosophila)
		2. Drosophila = fruit fly
	5. 1918: R. A. Fisher begins the study of quantitative genetics by partitioning phenotypic variance into a genetic and an environmental component
		1. P = G + E
			1. Phenotype = Genotypic Variance + Environmental Variance
			2. Genotypic variance can be broken down into breeding value (Bv) and gene combination value (GCv)
			3. Environmental variance can be broken down into permanent environment (Ep) and temporary environment (Et)
	6. 1926: Hermann J. Muller shows that x-rays can induce mutations
	7. 1944: Oswald Avery, Colin Macleod, and Maclyn McCarty show that DNA can transform bacteria, demonstrating that DNA is the hereditary material
		1. DNA, not protein
	8. 1953: James Watson and Francis Crick determine the structure of DNA molecule, which directly leads to knowledge of how it replicates
	9. 1966: Marshall Nirenberg solves the genetic code, showing that three DNA bases code for one amino acid
	10. 1972: Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer combine DNA from two different species *in vitro*, then transform it into bacterial cells
		1. First DNA cloning
		2. BAC libraries in artificial chromosomes
	11. 2001: Sequence of the entire human genome is announced
		1. Sequencing can determine the locations of all genes

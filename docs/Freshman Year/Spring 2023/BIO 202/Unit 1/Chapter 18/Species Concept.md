1. Species -> Latin "kind" or "appearance"
	1. 20+ definitions based on research
	2. Biological, morphological, & ecological
	3. Biological species refers to. . .
		1. Group of populations of the same "kind" of organism
		3. May naturally interbreed to produce viable offspring
		5. Do *not* interbreed or produce viable offspring w/ a "different" kind
	4. Grizzly bear (*U. arctos*) and Polar bear (*U. maritimus*)
		1. Hybrid = "grolar bear"
			1. Not commonly seen but polar bears coming more and more in contact w/ grizzly bears
			2. The hybrid may be better than grizzly or polar in the area 
	5. Limitations of species definition
		1. Limited to reproduction definition
		2. Does not apply to asexual reproducers
		3. Hybrids may routinely occur naturally
2. Speciation
	1. Formation of two species from one
	2. Allopatric speciation
		1. Allopatric = "other" "homeland
		2. Occurs due to geographic isolation
			1. Ex: lake water level drop or river as a barrier
			2. Two new species result from geographic barriers
		3. Adaptive radiation
			1. Quick expansion to fit different niches in the environment
			2. One spp radiates into many species to fit new/different environmental conditions
		4. Mosquitofish
			1. With & without predator
				1. Different pressures in different ponds
			2. Body depth changes
				1. Deep -> burst swimming
					1. Better for getting away from predators
				2. Long -> steady swimming
					1. No predator risk
		5. Snapping shrimp
			1. Atlantic & Pacific spp.
			2. Isthmus of Panama separates the shrimp
				1. Gradual formation of the isthmus over period from 10 to 3 mya
			3. 15 spp. on the Atlantic side now and 15 species on the Pacific side
				1. Sister species in similar habitats that arose due to geographic barrier
	3. Sympatric speciation
		1. Sympactric = "same" "homeland"
		2. Gene flow may be disrupted
		4. Two new species result within the same area
			1. No geographic isolation
		3. Gene flow may occur
			1. Polyploidy
				1. Very common in plants
				2. Greater than 2 chromosome copies
			2. Autopolyploid
				1. Occurs from a cell division error
				2. Tetraploid cells
				3. Must self-pollinate so they are isolated from 2N plants
					1. Yields new species
			3. Allopolyploid
				1. Interbreeding species
				2. Hybrid often sterile
					1. But the hybrid can undergo asexual reproduction
					2. May become fertile, create new species, and breed w/ each other
				3. Ex: Normal gamete from species A (n = 3) + Normal gamete from species B (n = 2) -> sterile hybrid zygote (n = 5)
			4. Sexual selection
				1. Two different species that mate at different times of yr or use different colors
				2. Ex:  Lake Victoria cichlids
					1. Specification 100,000 ya
					2. Females select males and males differ by color
					3. Different light spectrums
			5. Habitat differentiation
				1. Sub populations
				2. Exploit different resources
				3. Ex: Apple vs Blueberry maggot fly
					1. Apply maggots attracted to different food resources than blueberry maggots
					2. Apples develop faster
						1. Example of temporal isolation as well
		5. Prezygotic Barriers
			1. Before zygote
			2. Habitat isolation
				1. Two species -> two habitats
				2. Within the same area but encounters are rare
				3. Prevents mating
				4. Ex: *Rhagoletis spp* (fruit magot flies)
					1. Apple vs blueberry
			3. Temporal isolation
				1. Seasonality of breeding
				2. Day/night, spring/fall, different yrs outright, etc.
				3. Prevents mating
				4. Ex: *Spilogale spp* (skunks)
					1. Western (L-sum)/Eastern (L-winter)
			4. Behavioral isolation
				1. Different courtship rituals between species
					1. Male mating displays
				2. Prevents mating
				3. Birds of paradise (44 spp)
					1. Highly diverse dances act as behavioral isolation
			5. Mechanical isolation
				1. Mating attempted but mismathed copulation
				2. Prevents fertilization
				3. Ex: *Bradybaena spp* (snails)
					1. Shell spirals & genital openings
					2. Misalignment prevents exchange
			6. Gametic isolation
				1. Disparate morphology of sperm
				2. Physical or biochemical barrier
				3. Even when multiple sperm/egg around, they don't fertilize one another (just matches to species)
				4. Prevents fertilization
				5. Ex: *Strongylocentrotus* spp
					1. Broadcast spawning of gametes
					2. Purple & red urchin sperm protein
					3. Many gametes are around but cross-fertilization does not occur
		6. Postzygotic Barriers
			1. Fertilization has occurred (after zygote)
			2. Reduced hybrid viability
				1. Survival is low
				2. Ex: *Ensatina* spp (salamanders)
					1. Hybrids fail to completely develop
			3. Reduced hybrid fertility
				1. Individuals are sterile bc chromosomal number differs 
				2. Ex: Donkey (M) (62) + Horse (F) (64) = Mule (63 chromosomes)
					1. Donkey (F) + Horse (M) = Hinny
			4. Hybrid breakdown
				1. 1st generation may be fertile but subsequent generations are not
				2. Ex; Rice hybrids carry recessive allele
					1. Accumulate recessive allele
					2. Next generation is small/sterile
3. Hybrid zones
	1. Overlap of species where they can interact
	2. Patterns
		1. Spatially explicit overlap zone
		2. Patches vs boundary overlap
		3. Alleles change within the zone
		4. Ex: Yellow and Fire-bellied toads
			1. Near 100% of YB or FB at edges
			2. As hybrid develops, problems occur
	3. Environment
		1. Climate change shifts zones
		2. Ex: S. and N. flying squirrels
			1. Ranges never overlapped before but recent shift of Southern squirrels northward
			2. Ranges naturally overlap now
			3. May provide buffer to climate change
				1. Sharing of genetics may help one species or the other
				2. Hybrid "vigor"
					1. When the sharing of genetics creates a hybrid that is better suited to the environment than the parent species
	4. What may occur with hybrids?
		1. Temporary reconnection
		2. Reestablished gene flow possible
		3. Real-time speciation observation
	5. Reinforcement
		1. Strengthening reproductive barriers
		2. Ex: European and Collard fly-catcher
			1. Females select male mates
			2. Allopatric -> males similar
				1. Confusion may result if both species present
				2. Occurs when they were separated for long time then reintroduced
			3. Reinforcement of repro barriers within sympatric
			4. [[Natural Selection]] is the agent of change
	6. Fusion
		1. Weakening of repro barriers
		2. Gene pools become increasingly alike
			1. Speciation reverses and biodiversity goes down overall
			2. Ex: Brook vs Bull trout hybrid
				1. Bull = threatened western species
				2. Brook = introduced eastern species into the west
				3. Brook are outcompeting and hybridizing w/ bull
				4. Hybrid may further stress bull trout
	7. Stability
		1. Continued formation of hybrid individuals
		2. Ex: Yellow and fire-bellied toads
			1. Both routinely enter the hybrid zones
			2. Consistent hybrid zone forms
			3. True regardless of low hybrid success
			4. Narrow zone increases mating chances but wider zone likely decreases hybrids
4. Time for Speciation
	1. Average of 6.5 mya
		1. Shortest -> 4,000 years
		2. Longest -> 40 million years
		3. Depends on persistence & cataclysm
		4. Described in fossils and DNA
	2. Punctuated model
		1. Short speciation period followed by prolonged stabilization
		2. Abrupt extinction
	3. Gradual model
		1. Small, incremental changes over the entire period
		2. Produces two species over longer time

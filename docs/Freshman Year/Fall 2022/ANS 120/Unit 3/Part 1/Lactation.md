1. Lactation Physiology
	- Udder = Where mammary glands are connected together by connective tissue
		1. Each are individual units
	- Mammary Glands = [[Milk]] producing organs
		1. [[Cattle (Bovine)|Cows]] have 4 Mammary Gland
		2. Pigs have 12-14
		3. Ewes have 2
		4. Cats have 8-10
		5. Dogs have 10
		6. Deer have 2
		7. Elephant have 2
		8. Whale has 2
		9. Giraffe has 2
		10. Tend to be in even numbers and typically have twice the num of mammary glands for the avg of offspring 
		11. Alveolus = [[Milk]] synthesizing units
			- Millions of them in mammary glands
				1. Can each produce about 1/5 of a drop
				2. Take nutrients and put them in [[Milk]]
			- Myoepithelial cells surround the alveolus
				1. Individual smooth muscle cells (can contract)
				3. If stimulated, the cells contract and the milk is pushed down
		12. [[Milk]] ducts 
			- Small collecting ducts 
			- Large collecting ducts
			- When myoepithelial contracts, the [[Milk]] is let down into these ducts 
		13. Gland cistern
			- 2 lbs. capacity
		14. Teat cistern
			- Can hold about a mouthful
		15. Furstenberg's Rosette = One way valve
			- Allows milk to come out but blocks stuff from coming in
			- Stays open while milking
			- Post dip protects things from getting in valve 
		16. Streak canal
	- [[Milk]] Let Down = Oxytocin
		1. >60% of milk is contained in upper regions of mammary glands
		2. Stimulus to release hormone oxytocin
			- Oxytocin results in contraction of myoepithelial cells that force [[Milk]] down into collecting ducts
		3. The smells, people, sound of milking machine, sight of calf, etc. can let milk down
2. Milking Frequency 
	- 400 gallons of blood circulation required to provide nutrients for 1 gallon of milk
	- [[Milk]] synthesis rate and milking frequency
		1. Once mammary gland is full, the cow stops producing milk
		2. Rate of milk synthesis decreases w/ time post-milking
			- Lots of milk made right after milking, but around six hours, production stops and mammary glands are full
			- Milking every six hours maximizes overall production
			- Most dairies now [[Milk]] three times a day instead of two
		3. Control = Intramammary pressure
			- Neural system
			- More pressure = decreased milk synthesis and vise versa
3. Lactation Cycles
	- [[Milk]] production is usually the highest at early lactation
		1. When offspring needs the most milk
	- As more time passes and offspring grows, milk production decreases
	- Holstein
		1. Post-calving, produces about 50 lb/day initially. Rapidly increases to max of 75 lb/day. Then decreases over the course of 44 weeks to about 25 lb/day
		2. Meet breeds show dramatic difference from Holstein
	- Horses
		1. Some [[Horse (Equine)|horses]] can produce as much [[Milk]] as a [[Dairy]] [[Cattle (Bovine)|cow]]
			- Not good jersey compared to good horse can produce similar level
			- How can a horse produce similar levels of milk as cattle w/ smaller udder?
				1. Nursing Bout = Nursing Event
				2. Nursing removes [[Milk]], which decreases intramammary pressure so milk production continues
				3. Calf nurses about once every 4-6 hours
				4. Foal nurses once every 45 minutes
				5. Difference in rate of removal
					- Removing [[Milk]] more frequency = increases frequency of milk synthesis
	- Calving interval = Time between one offspring to the next 
		1. [[Dairy]] [[Cattle (Bovine)|cows]] has 12-month calving interval
			- Day 0 = calving
			- Day 80 = breeding
			- Day 305 = drying (no [[Milk]] removal so nutrients eventually reabsorbed and udder can repair itself)
				1. Udder insulation = Repair mammary glands for next lactation cycle
			- Day 365 = calving
		2. Most dairies do not do 12 month calving intervals anymore
			- Now do 13 month intervals
				1. Day 0 = calving
				2. Day 110 = breeding
				3. Day 335 = drying
				4. Day 395 = calving
			- Or 14 month intervals
				1. Day 0 = calving
				2. Day 140 = breeding
				3. Day 365 = drying
				4. Day 425 = calving
			- Economic Threshold - $ money return required to meet $ cost
			- What if cow produces [[Milk]] at a level above the economic threshold when drying would occur on a 12 month calving interval?
				1. 13-14 month makes more sense for higher milk production level
4. [[Dairy]]

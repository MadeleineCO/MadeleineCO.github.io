1. Plasma portion
	1. 55% of blood
	2. 95% water
	3. Transportation
		1. Nutrients
		2. CO2 (25%)
		3. Nitrogenous waste
		4. Cholesterol
		5. Ions
			1. Electrolytes, vitamins, minerals
		6. Hormones
		7. Proteins
			1. Albumin, which is important for osmolarity regulation 
2. Cellular portion
	1. 45% of blood
	2. Mostly red blood cells (aka "erythrocytes")
		1. Hemoglobin w/ Fe2+
		2. Transports O2 and CO2 (75%)
		3. Anemia
			1. Results from low Fe2+ (genetic), low vitamin B, or hemolytic causes
		4. Erythropoietin
			1. Stimulates RBC production in the bone marrow
			2. When travelling to high altitudes, body produces more RBCs
	3. White blood cells (aka "leukocytes")
		1. Immune system cells
		2. Defense component
		3. Monocytes are undifferentiated cells that differentiated when told to
			1. Can become macrophages
		4. Neutrophils are in constant circulation in blood
			1. One of first forms of defense
	4. Platelets
		1. Cellular fragments
		2. Created by megakaryocyte
		3. Initiate blood clotting
			1. Platelets adhere to exposed collagen
			2. Prothrombin and fibrinogen are inactive proteins that activate when clotting is necessary
				1. Prothrombin -> Thrombin
				2. Create fibrous network 
3. Thin buffy coat between plasma and cellular portion
4. Blood Vessels 
	1. Arteries
		1. Thick, smooth muscles
			1. Capable of forceful contraction
			2. Allows us to regulate body heat
				1. If cold, vasoconstriction
				2. If hot, vasodilation
					1. Allows more blood to flow through
				3. F = (P1 - P2) / R (resistance to flow)
					1. R = 8nL / pir^2
					2. Even a small change in radius causes a great change in resistance to flow
		2. More elastic layers
		3. Thinner connective tissue
		4. Arteries get smaller and become arterioles, which become capillaries
	2. Veins
		1. Few elastic layers
		2. Thin, smooth muscle
		3. Thicker connective tissue
		4. Contain one-way valves to promote unidirectional flow
		5. Veins become venules
		6. Less muscle and flexible
		7. Venous valves and pumps
			1. Fluid retention can cause edema (swelling due to fluid retention)
		8. Skeletal muscle is important 
		9. Varicose veins allow expansion
	3. Capillaries
		1. Get as small as 1 cell thick (1 mm length)
		3. Exchange and absorption
			1. Nutrients, gasses, water, etc.
		4. Greatest cross-sectional area

Neuromuscular Synapse and Muscular Contraction::![[Pasted image 20230405191957.png]]
^1680737598364

Process of muscular contraction::1 - Action potential reaches neuromuscular junction; 2 - Ca^2+ enters the pre-s.c. cell; 3 - Exocytosis of ACh (NT), which binds to muscle cell (Na+ enters the post-s.c. cell); 4 - T-tubule depolarizes; 5 - Sarcoplasmic reticulum releases Ca^2+ so muscle contraction occurs; 7 - Ca^2 pumped back into SR so muscle contraction stops
^1680737598371

Neuromuscular Synapse::![[Pasted image 20230405192253.png]]
^1680737598378

Sarcoplasmic Reticulum::Stores Ca+; When depolarization occurs, Ca+ is released so that muscle contraction occurs (pumping Ca^2 back into SR stops muscle contraction)
^1680737598385

Tropomyosin (TPM)::Found on actin (main myofilament); Blocks binding sites so that myosin cannot attach
^1680737598393

Troponin (TPN)::Found on actin and TPM; Holds actin and tropomyosin
^1680737598399

Calcium (Ca^2+) Regulation of Muscle Contraction::Low Ca^2+ = TPM inhibits cross-bridge and blocks binding sites (prevents myosin from binding); High = TPN changes conformation and exposes binding sites 
^1680737598410

Low calcium in the muscles causes ---::TMP to inhibit cross-bridge and block myosin binding sites
^1680737598416

High calcium in the muscles causes ---::TPN to change conformation and allow myosin to bind; Conformation change pulls TPM away so that myosin can then attach
^1680737598422

[[2023-07-23]]
Sliding Filament Theory::"Sliding" of myofilaments to contract sarcomeres; Myosin and actin slide past each other to create muscular contractions
^1680933218752

Singerly, one sarcomere doesn't do much, but wholistically can ---::contract the entire muscle
^1680933218763

Trypanin and Tropomyosin regulate ---::muscular contraction based on the presence or absence of calcium; Increasing in calcium results in changing TPN conformation so that myosin can bind
^1680933218771

Sliding Filament Process::1 - Ca^2 is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum 2 - Ca^2 in the sarcoplasm binds TPN and exposes myosin-binding sites on actin filaments 3 - Myosin heads bind to actin 4 - Release of Pi initiates power stroke 5 - In power stroke, myosin head changes conformation so that filaments slide past one another 6 - ADP is released at end of power stroke and ATP binds back to myosin, causing it to release actin 7 - Hydrolysis of ATP returns myosin head to "cocked" position 8 - If Ca^2 remains available, contraction continues. If Ca^2 returned to sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscle relaxes
^1680933218779

If Ca^2 remains available after power stroke, cycle repeats and contraction continues. If Ca^2 is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the ---::muscle relaxes
^1680933218786

Muscular contraction requires ---::ATP; If dead, no ATP is available and muscles stiffen (no ATP to break crossbridge)
^1680933218795

Muscular Twitch Response::Can measure muscle by force in response to stimulus over time; Can stimulate muscles using electricity
^1680933218802

Muscle force eventually reaches platue where muscle cannot ---::contract any more despite the level/rate of stimuli; Called muscular tetanus
^1680933218810

*Clostridium tetani* causes muscles to ---::contract and not relax (esp facial muscles so you cannot eat); Anaerobic bacteria
^1680933218817

^1680933218825

^1680933218834

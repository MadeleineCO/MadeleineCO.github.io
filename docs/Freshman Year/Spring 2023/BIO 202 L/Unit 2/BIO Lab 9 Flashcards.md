Hypertonic Solution::Water moves outside of the cell, resulting in shriveled cells
^1679534555903

Hypotonic Solution::Water moves inside the cell, resulting in enlarged cells
^1679534555910

In plants, the cell wall prevent cells from bursting in --- solutions::hypotonic; High turger pressure
^1679534555918

Diffusion::Movement of molecules from high to low concentration; Will eventually equilibrate if given opportunity; Plasma membrane can be barrier to diffusion depending on size and polarity
^1679534555927

Osmosis::The diffusion of water; Can cross cell membrane passively across concentration gradient
^1679534555934

Tonicity::When comparing two solutions, one w/ *higher* concentration of solute is **hypertonic** and one w/ *lower* concentration of solute is **hypotonic**
^1679534555942

Water always moves from --- to ---::hypo to hyper (less solute --> more solute; more water --> less water); Net movement
^1679534555950

The two possible diagnosis were --- or ---::epilepsy or cerebral edema as symptoms included seizures 
^1679535881987

What is your diagnosis?::*Cerebral edema* bc there is increased pressure in the brain matrix, which alters neuron firing rate and function; Treatment = use a *hypertonic* solution to save Clark
^1679535881997

In what direction is water moving initially?::Out of vessel (hypertonic matrix)
^1679535882003

Normal Matrix (Na, Pressure) Ranges::137-146 mmol/L and 5-15 mmHg (p); CC = 137 (normal) and 27 (high)
^1679535882009

Normal Blood (Na, Pressure) Ranges::137-146 mmol/L and 20-25 mmHg (p); CC = 114 (low) and 22 (normal)
^1679535882015

Normal Neurons (Firing Rate) Range::2.3-3.5/sec; CC = 4.5/sec (high)
^1679535882022

Treatment I - Hypertonic Saline::Resulted in homeostasis (yay!); Water flowed into the vessel until balance achieved; All numbers within normal range
^1679535882029

Treatment II - Isotonic Saline::Caused no significant difference in numbers or water flow (still moving out of vessel)
^1679535882036

Treatment III - Hypotonic Solution::Worsened Clark's situation; Water continued to flow out of the vessel; Numbers worsened
^1679535882043

Why is water moving into the vessel after the administration of the hypertonic solution?::Increased solute concentration inside blood vessels so that vessels were hypertonic compared to the matrix until homeostasis restored
^1679535882050

Why is water moving outside the vessel after the administration of the hypotonic solution?::The vessels already hypotonic relative to the matrix, so adding a solution higher in water and lower in solute only exacerbated the issue
^1679535882058

Why is water moving outside the vessel after the administration of the isotonic saline?::The isotonic saline is relatively balanced so it did not change the tonicity of the vessels and nothing was fixed or exacerbated
^1679535882066

What effect does the net movement of water have on the pressure in the matrix?::Net movement *outside* of the cell contributed to *high* pressure in the matrix; Net movement *inside* the cell *lowered* the pressure of the matrix; Due to changes in volume
^1679535882074

How does the relative concentration of sodium affect the firing rate of nerves?::*Lower* sodium in the vessels *increases* firing rate of nerves; An *increase* in sodium in the vessels *decreases* firing rate of nerves
^1679535882082

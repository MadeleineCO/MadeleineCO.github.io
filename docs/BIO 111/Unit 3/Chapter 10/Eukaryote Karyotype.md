1. [[Cell Reproduction]]
	- Particular array of chromosomes in an individual [[Organism]]
			1. Arranged according to size, staining properties, location of centromere, etc.
		- Eukaryotes have linear chromosomes
			1. Will have diploid number and haploid number
		- Humans are diploid (2n)
			1. 2 complete sets of chromosomes
			2. 46 total chromosomes
		- Haploid (n) = 1 set of chromosomes 
			1. 23 in humans
				- 1 haploid set from mother and 1 haploid set in father
					1. Gametes (sperm and egg) are haploid
				- 2 haploid pairs = 1 diploid set
					1. Zygote is first diploid [[Cell]] that occurs after sperm and egg combine
		- Number of chromosomes and size of genome not related to complexity
		- Pair of chromosomes are homologous
			1. Each one is a homologue
		- Chromosomes have tightly compacted [[DNA]]
			1. Can see it at a certain stage in [[Cell]] division under a microscope
				- Can then stain them bc dyes can bind to acids and change their color
			2. As chromosomes pair, the homologue pairs can be arranged by size
				- Number 1 is largest and 22 is smallest
					1. 1-22 called autosomes
				- 23rd pair can be homologues (identical) but can also be non homologous (non identical)
					1. Females have homologous 23rd pair (XX)
					2. Males do not have a homologous 23rd pair (XY)
						- Y chromosome is really small
						- Only has about 250 genes
					1. Called sex chromosomes
			3. The pieces of [[DNA]] are wrapped around histones
				- Called chromatin material (complex of DNA and [[Protein]])
					1. Also RNA (site of RNA synthesis)
				- The chromatin material is tightly packed into chromosomes
					1. [[DNA]] of a single chromosome is one long continuous double-stranded fiber
						- Total human chromosome is 140 nucleotides long
						- About 6.5 ft of DNA in a single chromosome
						- [[DNA]] wrapped over itself (already wrapped around histones some)
							1. Called supercoiling
							2. Can get very tight and condensed 
					2. Nucleosome
						- Complex of DNA wrapped around histone [[Protein|proteins]]
							1. Appearance of beads on a string
							2. When [[Cell]] undergoes mitosis, chromosomes condense even further
							3. Two copies in chromosome
						- Promote and guide coiling of DNA
						- [[DNA]] duplex coiled around 8 histone [[Protein|proteins]] every 200 nucleotides
						- Histones are positively charged and strongly attracted to DNA
					3. Ends of chromosome called telomeres 
						- Region of constriction around the middle or off to one side or another called centromere
						- The short arm of chromosome is called P arm
						- The long arm of chromosome is called Q arm
						- Particular genes located on chromosome then P arm or Q arm then a particular location of the arm
							1. Like an address
							2. Mapped so you can know where a particular gene is
				- Chromosomes occupy certain regions of the nucleus when *not* highly condensed
					1. Arrangement of chromosomes called karyotype 
				- When [[Cell]] starts to divide, they become tightly packed and we can then see them w/ microscopes
		- Gene = a region of a chromosome w/ specific genetic info
			1. Dispersed throughout all chromosome
		- In the nondividing nucleus, if chromosomes spread out, called Euchromatin (expressed)
			1. Transcriptionally active (DNA --> mRNA) if spread out
		- If tightly packed in nondividing nucleus, called Heterochromatin (not expressed)
			1. Transcriptionally silent ([[DNA]] not converted into mRNA)

1. Components of Swine Performance
	1. Genetic ability of the pig
	2. Environment

			2. Adherence to color bc controversy that led to spotted breed
		3. Paternal Breed
	8. Spot
		1. Derived from Polands that failed to adhere to color rules 
		2. Spots were able to make more progress and improvements 
			1. More of spotted breed than Poland China

3. Goal of Genetics Program
	1. Don't let inferior genetics or the mating system to limit production efficiency
		1. Identify a better source if genetics is limiting factor in obtaining max production performance
			1. Usually *not* the case
		2. Be sure you are using correct mating system that maximizes performance
		3. Be sure that herd health is not limiting performance
			1. May require herd depopulation and repopulation w/ healthy superior genetics
				1. Be sure to understand the costs of this choice
			2. If relocating operations, may be good time to update genetics and improve health
4. Available Genetic Resources
	1. Genetic Supplier
		1. Many breeding companies and choices for suppliers
	2. Breeds or Lines
		1. Choose the lines that excel for the traits that are important in your markets
		2. PIC = Pig Improvement Company
	3. Choice of Individual animals within the pop (breed or line) of choice
		1. Choose animals that meet your selection criteria
		2. The avg of those you select compared to the entire group of potential select animals = selection differential 
			1. (x - mx)
			2. The greater the selection differential, the faster the rate of genetic progress
	4. Selection can be at Nucleus (great grandparent), Multiplier (grandparent), or Commercial (parent) levels
		1. Genetic improvement through selection is a slow, tedious process
		2. Be sure selection is for important market traits
		3. Keep your eye on the selection goals
	5. Mating Systems
		1. Use mating systems that match your management preferences
		2. Maximizes heterosis
		3. Make use of breed complementarity 
	6. See Triangle for structure of breeding system 
		1. Nucleus (GGP) -> Multiplier (GP) -> Commercial (P)
		2. Boars for semen
		3. ---
5. Heritability
	1. Seven traits of economic importance in swine
		1. Four Repro traits - low h^2
			1. Number born alive (NBA)
			2. Number weaned (NW)				
			3. Sow longevity (SPL)
				1. How long the sow stays in the herd (similar to stayabilitiy in cattle)
			4. 21 day litter wgt (LWT21)
				1. Litter wgt at three weeks 
		2. Two Growth Traits - low to mod h^2
			1. Days to 115 kg/250 lb (D250)
			2. Feed efficiency (F:G and G:F)		
				1. Feet to gain 
				2. Gain to feed
		3. One Carcass Trait - high h^2
			1. Backfat thickness (BF10)
	2. See graph for h^2 ---
	3. Trait Consideration and Selection
		1. Choose traits that economically impact the operation 
			1. NBA - is the salable item produce by the sow
			2. 21d litter wgt - ---
			3. ---
		2. Consider if the traits can be measured accurately and in a repeatable fashion
			1. Influences h^2 and rate at which traits can be improved
		3. Consider if the traits have sufficient variation, specifically genetic variation, ---
			1. ---
6. Features Necessary For Selection
	1. Equal opportunity
		1. No animals recieve preferential treatment
	2. Systematic measuremnet of all animals
		1. Ex: measure BF in same way, location, and wgt on every animal
	3. Env adjustments
		1. Ex: parity (number of times that animal has given birth), season of year, test wgt, etc.
			1. See equation ---
			2. Genetic variance / (genetic variance + env variance) = h^2
	4. NSIF adjustment factors
		1. See URL ---
		2. Used to accurately measure traits
	5. Use of records
		1. No good recording data if you don't use it
		2. Use records to assist selection decisions 
7. STAGES (Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System)
	1. National Swine Registry (NSR)
		1. For Duroc, Hampshire, Landrace, and Yorkshire
			1. Two maternal breeds (L and Y) and two paternal breeds (D and H)
		2. Includes F1 (Landrace x Yorkshire) data to make maternal data more accurate
	2. Use a multi-trait animal model for genetic selection 
	3. Generate Daily across-herd-EPDs on association computers
	4. Consider Breed specific variance components and adjustments
	5. www.nationalswine.com
	6. Ex: Postweaning Data
		1. Pigs scanned at or near 250 lbs
			1. Most ideally set this off-test wgt at your ideal market wgt
		2. Most breeders scan every 3-4 weeks
		3. Boars, gilts, and barrows
		4. Record wgt, backfat, and loin muscle area
		5. Data sent to NSR office every day
			1. Results returned to breeder next day
		6. Allows breeders to compare animals to see if they are making progress
	7. STAGES Program Components
		1. Records of ancestry (pedigree)
		2. Performance measurement program
		3. EBV estimation program
		4. ---
	8. Data Procedures
		1. Litter data recorded in farrowing house, including. . .
			1. Pedigree info (sire and dam)
			2. Date farrowed
			3. Number born alive
			4. Number after transfer (num allowed to nurse)
			5. 21d litter wgt
		2. Data sent to NSR office when litter is recorded
			1. Use selection index
		3. See certificate of registry
8. Mating Systems
	1. Purebreeding 
		1. Used at the nucleus (GGP) level and some level at multiplication 
		2. Inbreeding
			1. Try to avoid inbreeding
		3. Linebreeding
		4. Outcrossing
	2. Crossbreeding
		1. Used at the multiplication level and at commercial level
			1. Terminal Systems
			2. Rotational Systems
			3. Rotaterminal Systems
			4. System choice depends on. . .
				1. Health of herd
				2. Management level
				3. Cost 
				4. Other
			5. System goal = maximize heterosis/hybrid vigor
				1. Why max heterosis?
					1. It is **free**
						1. Producers waste money if they don't take advantage 
					2. It effects traits involving fitness that typically influence profitability the most
						1. Conception rates (does sow breed or not)
						2. Number born and num born alive (limits num of pigs that eventually will be sold)
						3. Longevity (hov long sow remains in breeding herd)
						4. And other repro traits
					3. Must make sure that mating system of choice is ---
		2. Breed Complementarity 
			1. No breed of pig is perfect or ideal for all traits
			2. Crossbreeding allows opportunity to mix breeds to create pig that is more ideal than any of parent breeds would have been
			3. Ideally, a crossbreeding plan would mix breeds that compliment each other
				1. Strong points of one breed may offset the weaker characteristics of another, resulting in more complete, problem-free pigs
			4. See chart (list of reeds and traits they excel in)
				1. Paternal or maternal ---
9. Selecting Against Detrimentals
	1. PSE 
		1. Meat is pale soft and exudative (PSS)
		2. Testing for PSE
			1. Two types of Porcine Stress Syndrome genes
				1. Napole (RN) and Halothane (HAL) genes
				2. RN is a dominant allele (RN-) and a recessive allele (rn+) that is simply inherited on one locus
					1. RN- reduces the ultimate pH of the muscle, which reduces WHC (water-holding capacity) and increases purge, especially in ham and loin
					2. Creates "acid meat" by reducing pH
				3. HAL is a mutation on chromosome 6 of the pig at nucleotide 1843
					1. Increases lean meat content but enhances PSE and PSS
					2. PSS is when animal lacks ability to adapt to stress
					3. HAL is inherited from single locus where there are two alleles (N = normal and n = mutant)
					4. HAL has three possibilities = NN (normal), ---
					5. ---
				4. Autosomal Recessive
		3. All poor pork quality is not due to HAL (only about 20% of poor pork quality was negative for HAL)
			1. Yet eliminating ---
		4. PSS Genetic Influence
			1. Worst condition is homo rec for HAL and RN
				1. Produces watery, chewy, undesirable carcasses
			2. Reproduce at lower rates and often die before getting to breeding herd
			3. Heterozygous don't show signs ---
			4. Either homo or hetero will cause problems (either in transit or at packing plant)
			5. If you ---
		5. Nebraska SPF claims that they were first to have stress-free herds
		6. American Yorkshire Club first to take stand against stress gene
		7. Any York boar used for AI or natural had to have DNA testing and be free in order to be registered
		8. Duroc and Chester White Associations were second and third to pass similar rules 
	2. Porcine Congenital Splay Leg Syndrome
		2. Paralyzed hind limbs
	3. Atresia ani
		1. No anus/rectum
		2. Condition is heritable w/ low penetrance
			1. Makes it harder to identify animals that have this

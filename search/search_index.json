When startled or excited, fall over w/ stiff legs         3. Physiological condition when startled, both biceps and triceps lock up             - Defect             - Can create injuries, scar tissue, etc.             - Easy for predators 10. Far fewer goats than sheep     - Spread out across the US 11. Good for contract grazing     - Eat wider variety of forage     - Goats can be used when grapes dormant (eat weeds) then bring in sheep when grapes appear     - Goats in Argania trees         1. Argan oil comes from trees         2. Very expensive oil         3. Use goats for harvesting             - Goats eat fruit then extract nuts and oil from feces     - Goats can go feral easily         1. Overgrazing         2.

Reproduction     - Cats are polyestrous (have multiple estrus cycles per year)     - Estrous cycles avg of 14-21 days but can rang from 4-30d     - Estrus lasts about 7-8 days     - Tend to be seasonal         1. Increase in estrous cycles in spring and fall (different from short day, long day)         2. Can still do whatever overall     - Induced ovulation          1. Breeding must occur to start events leading to ovulation (neural reflex)         2. Stimulates neural reflex (nervous system is involved) after mating occurs         3. If cat does not mate, follicles regress and decompose without ovulation         4. If cat does mate, corpus luteum grows, P4 and pregnancy, parturition, lactation         5. Rabbits also have induced ovulation          6. False pregnancy             - Uterus expands, mammary development, some even have false labor             - More commonly occurs in induced ovulation animals     - If animal is indoors, tend to show more estrous cycles than those outdoors         1.

production process (one company owns every step of the process); Major companies include Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Wayne Farms, etc. ^1669072458920</p> <p>Types of meat birds::Ancestor = Asian jungle fowl (relatively small; 4-6 lbs in 3+ years); Broiler reaches 4-5 lbs in 35-45 days ^1669072458932</p> <p>Breeding facility for eggs (hatchery)::Laying hen facilities w/ nest boxes and roosters; Eggs go into incubators w/ right temp and rotation; Can then ship chicks (they are fine up till about a week bc of yoke rudiments) ^1669072458940</p> <p>Sexing chicks by looking at ---::wing feathers; If uneven rows of covert feathers, its a pullet; If rows are even, its a cockrel; May also be able to sex by vent anatomy ^1669072458947</p> <p>After hatchery, chicks are shipped to ---::broiler houses (grower); Privately owned but contracted by large companies; Process called all in-all out (bring chicks in all at one time then move out all at one time) ^1669072458954</p> <p>Broiler life cycle::Day 0 = fertilization in hatchery; Day 21 = chicks hatch and transferred to grower; Day 60 - all chickens are removed (35-50 days post-hatching); After day 60 in grower, sterilization/sanitation occurs and by day 75, more chicks enter grower (5-8 broods/year) ^1669072458962</p> <p>Growers provide ---::climate control, pulley system for feed and waters to facilitate movement of birds; Heater; Food and water (although yolk sac provides nutrients for first couple days) ^1669072458969</p> <p>Chicks are typically moved out of grower ---::at night bc they are calmer; All chicks move out at once; Then clean litter (usually sawdust) and sanitize before starting over ^1669072458977</p> <p>[[2022-11-30]] Growers can have --- broods/year::5-8; Time from all in to all out is about 35-50 days then sanitation after all out takes about 15 more days ^1669867873640</p> <p>The asian jungle fowl (chicken ancestor) produces about --- eggs per year::4-10; Now our white leghorns produce about 290 per year  ^1669867873652</p> <p>Birds are almost like --- breeders::long day; longer photo period = more eggs in nature; We have lights in chicken houses that simulate long day ^1669867873660</p> <p>--- is the country that produces the most eggs by far::Asia; In the US, Ga is 6th greatest egg producer ^1669867873668</p> <p>Egg production has increased from 264 eggs to about --- per year::296 eggs; We are optimizing the environment ^1669867873677</p> <p>Egg consumption is --- in the US::going up overall; However, avian flu has killed birds more recently so slight drop (more expensive) ^1669867873684</p> <p>Vertical integration in the egg industry::Ownership of more than one step; Similar to broiler in that few companies are involved; Companies own almost all of process, from parent breeding to hatching to grow out to egg production to packer and retail ^1669867873691</p> <p>Egg laying birds are started in similar way to ---::broilers; Moved to grower 1-3 days post hatching; Unlike broilers that only stay for around 30 days, egg laying birds stay for 18-22 weeks (about 6 months); Much lower density and stay until they start laying ^1669867873697</p> <p>Egg laying birds tend to begin laying at ---::18-22 weeks; Stay in grower until they start laying then transferred to laying chicken houses ^1669867873702</p> <p>Battery cages::Conventional egg laying method; About 70% of hens; Rows of cages w/ slanted floor; Conveyor belts for eggs and fecal matter (keeps waste away); Automatic waters/feeders; We control environment (temp + humidity); 8-10 birds per cage ^1669867873707</p> <p>For about a year, we mimic --- for egg production::long day; Environmental control to increase production ^1669867873712</p> <p>Cage free system::Not in cages; About 30% of hens; Completely indoors; Have nest boxes (facilitates egg collection); Access to floor and roosting area; We still control environment ^1669867873719</p> <p>Potential issues w/ cage free system::Litter and manure don't have anywhere to go so higher mortality rates from disease ^1669867873724</p> <p>Free range system::Like cage free but w/ some access to outside; Access to forage is not required; Similar issues w/ waste as cage free ^1669867873731</p> <p>Pasture Raised::Have a cage free indoor area; Must have access to outdoor area and access to natural vegetation ^1669867873738</p> <p>Debeaking::Intent is to decrease injury/death due to cannibalism; Trims the tip to round it and prevent chickens from hurting other chickens ^1669867873746</p> <p>Enriched Colony system::Like conventional battery cage system but also has perch, nest box, and scratch pad ^1669867873753</p> <p>Cage free system actually has highest ---::mortality % due to sanitation and disease problems; Very tough issue to solve; Best way to minimize disease is to decrease density (but this lowers productivity); Egg cannibalism can be issue as well; Pro = less confinement but con = higher mortality/more disease ^1669867873760</p> <p>Conventional battery cages have the lowest ---::mortality % overall; Confinement is con but lower mortality and less disease is pro ^1669867873767</p> <p>Where are we headed w/ egg production/consumption?::1 in 6 Americans go hungry on any given day; We shouldn't make eggs more expensive; Very good food source; Cage free cost of production causes good food to be harder to aquire ^1669867873774</p> <p>Free range pros/cons::Con = predation; Mortality and disease depends on density; Pro = less confinement; Similar pros/cons to pasture raised ^1669867873782</p> <p>In conventional system, eggs move down conveyer belt to ---::scalding wash; In Europe, eggs are not washed bc eggs have pores that bacterial can live in to survive washing; Mucus film also prevents material from getting in egg and keeps egg hydrated; Healthwise washing vs nonwashing works out about the same ^1669867873789</p> <p>After washing, eggs go through the ---::candling process; Purpose is to check shell integrity; Looks for cracks and checks (pinhole cracks); Also looking for meat and blood spots (blood comes from follicle rupture and tissue is constantly replacing itself in bird so piece could get incorporated) ^1669867873796</p> <p>Some equipment can automize candling process by using ---::sound instead; Sound waves detect shell issues ^1669867873804</p> <p>Egg variations::Sometimes there are eggs w/ no shell (uterus skipped step); Eggs can be different sizes (Size determined by material that goes down oviduct such as yoke and albumin); Double ovulation can make extra large egg (two yokes); If fertilized, these eggs would not make it ^1669867873811</p> <p>After candling, eggs go through series of ---::grading; Size (class) and quality (grade) ^1669867873818</p> <p>Egg anatomy::Germinal around yoke is the unfertilized ovum; Albumin on inside (protein source); Chalazae holds yoke in the middle; Shell on outside ^1669867873826</p> <p>Size (class)::Based on weight by the dozen; Jumbo = 30 ounces; Extra large = 27; Large = 24; Medium = 21; Small = 18; Peewee = 15 ^1669867873833</p> <p>Quality (grade)::Depends on the size of air cell (determines the amount of material within the egg); AA has smallest air cell, then A, then B; Less air cell is better bc more material (more yoke + albumin) ^1669867873841</p> <p>Yolk color is controlled by ---::concentration of zanothophylls and carotenes; Color pigmentations that are diet-related; What bird eats controls coloration of yoke (insect tend to be redder, cottonseed makes yolks green) ^1669867873849</p> <p>Laying Life Cycle::Fertilization --&gt; Hatching (incubation takes 21 days); Moved to grower after hatching; At 6 months, all go out of grower to enter laying phase; Laying phase = 50 weeks; Induced molting = lasts 9-14 days after phase I; Laying Phase II = 30-40 weeks; May repeat cycle or may be shipped to processing ^1669867873857</p> <p>Laying phase I is --- weeks long::50; Controlled by 14 hrs of light and 10 hrs of darkness; Laying peak at about 20-30 weeks until before egg production goes down; Then need recovery time in form of induced molting ^1669867873864</p> <p>Induced molting::Occurs at the end of laying phase; Turn off lights to change diurnal (either 24 hrs light or 24 hrs dark; Usually dark to prevent fighting); Provide water but no food ^1669867873872</p> <p>Induced molting continues until the birds lose ---::about 25% of body weight; Birds quit laying eggs during this time; Gets rid of excess body fat and allows for repro tract involution (repair time) ^1669867873880</p> <p>Induced molting does not ---::force loss of feathers, but feathers do fall out more than they normally would bc stress of not eating; Not a true molting ^1669867873888</p> <p>Laying phase II is shorter than ---::phase I (50 weeks vs 35-40 weeks); After this phase, some may repeat cycle but most birds shipped to processing

The Nature of Atoms     A. Molecules are groups of atoms held together in stable associations     B.

Gain or loss of Electrons forms ions                 i. Na atom loses an electron to become Na+                 ii. Cl atom gains an electron to become CL-                 iii. Opposite charges attract so that Na+ and Cl- remain associated as an ionic compound             b. Electrical attraction of Water molecules can disrupt forces holding ions together         - Covalent bonds = form when atoms share 2 or more valence Electrons             a. Results in no net charge             b. Satisfies octet rule with no unpaired electrons             c. Strength of covalent bond depends on the number of shared electrons             d.

If sharing is completely equal, then it is a nonpolar covalent bond                 ii. If sharing is unequal, then it is a polar covalent bond                 iii. Both Water and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out and it is nonpolar overall                     ~ O - C - O (nonpolar molecule)                     ~ Water is in bent shape because of two negative H (polar molecule)                     ~ Methane has four H and one C.

Have central (alpha) carbon         - Amino group bonded to alpha C         - Each amino acid has different R group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature     C. Side chain         - Structure is different for different Amino Acids         - Some have only H and C             a. If only H and C, it is hydrophobic and non polar (Water)             b. Not same shape         - Some are polar             a. Can be charge         - Some have complex ring structures     D. Amino Acids are monomers         - Dehydration synthesis links them         - Peptide bonds are unique to proteins             a. Take carboxyl group of one amino acid and link it to amino group of another amino acid             b. Releases water molecule in process         - When you link amino acids in polymer chain, a single change can change structure, which greatly affects function             a. Ex: If glutamic acid is swapped with valine, you get sickle Cell shape                 i. Don't go through capillaries well                  ii. Don't transport oxygen well II. Protein structures - four different structures     A. Primary         - Sequence of a chain of amino acids (linear)         - Linear, sequential structure      B. Secondary         - Two alternative shapes             a. Alpha helix             b. Beta sheet         - Have NCC repeating for backbone             a. Creates the backbone of peptide bonds             b. Side chains are above the backbone or below the backbone                 i. Alternative above and below                 ii. Ex: Ones above are polar, ones below are nonpolar. Take beta sheet and form a tube. Polars are inside and nonpolar are outside. A protein biomolecule. Phospholipids make up membrane (hydrophobic outside and hydrophilic inside). Therefore, proteins can sit imbedded in the phospholipid membrane as a channel. Allows polar things to travel through membrane like a tunnel                     - Folding pattern of a protein due to side chain interactions             c. Plane of the sheet is NCC repeating backbone         - Hydrogen bonds determine shape (Chemical Bonds)             a. H bonds hold back together (repeating NCC)             b. Make beta sheet or alpha helix                 i. Form because of hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide backbone      C. Tertiary          - A proteins 3d, netted shape         - Some side chains can form ionic bonds (Chemical Bonds)             a. Positive sides or negative sides          - Particular shape determined by variety of chemical interactions including hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, and disulfide linkages              a. Cystine's (Amino Acids) side chain ends in SH (thyal) (sulfhydryl)                  i. Two cystines can form disulfide bonds or bridges (covalent)                 ii. Like a spot weld, hold and don't come apart                     ~ H bonds can be broken if you change temp or pH, but covalent bonds do not change, so disulfide bonds are permanent                      ~ Disulfide bonds make it more stable             a. Some side chains are non polar while others are polar                 i. Non polar side chains like to congregate and stay together                 ii. A protein can have a hydrophobic core when in aqueous solution {Water}         - When you denature a protein, it can be a permanent or temporary change             a. Ex: cooking egg whites creates a permanent change                  i. Protein albumin has been permanently denatured             b. Proteins with hydrophobic cores in Water solutions                 i. If you add more and more salt, the hydrophobic core may change and become more exposed. If you reduce the salt, it will fold into a hydrophobic core again                     ~ Temporarily denatured             c. We can isolate proteins by slightly modifying environment by pH (Acids and bases) or temperature             d. Proteins that are specifically designed to help other proteins maintain their shape                 i. Called chaperon (heat shock (hsp)) proteins                 ii. Fixes other proteins' tertiary structures         - Insulin             a. Has an alpha and a beta chain, initially one single chain but separated and now disulfide bridges hold them together             b. Must have correct structure to function     D. Quintenary         - Where two proteins interact and work together             a. Must work together to function III. Disulfide bonds     a. Cystine's (amino acid) side chain ends in SH (thyal) (sulfhydryl)          i. Two cystines can form disulfide bonds or bridges (covalent)         ii.

ions; Whenever there is oxygen present, other chemicals can become oxidized and free radicals can also occur (will break down membrane); Issues prevented by palacide layer of brick-like cells w/ chloroplast on top (bottom layer has more open, spongy spaces); Allows O2 to go out through stromata openings (also allows plants to gain necessary resources like CO2); Could lose water through

Each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by mitosis.  ^1666470494990</p> <p>Plant life cycle alternates between a multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both the haploid and diploid plant stages are ---::free-living. The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it produces haploid spores by meiosis.

Ex: the ABO blood group system shows multiple alleles (3 possible alleles of the I gene (IA, IB, and i); individuals only have two of these) and codominance (IA and IB are dominant to i but codominant to each other);

In countries w/ malaria, having one copy can be beneficial bc you experience less fatigue from malaria and less severe than two copies. <ol> <li>All viruses are nucleic acid wrapped in protein. Scientists can modify HIV virus so that it doesn't make you sick. Instead, it brings in the correct form of the beta-hemoglobin chain. Inserts gene to make round cells. Cell then incorporates it and produces other cells with that gene.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Cystic fibrosis results in problems w/ CFTR pump for Cl ions. Can't pump Cl out of lungs so Cl draws in water through osmosis, mucus thickens outside lungs, and bacteria can accumulate and breathing problems.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Incomplete dominance (blending inheritance) = the heterozygote is intermediate in phenotype between the 2 homozygotes</li> <li>Codominance = the heterozygote shows some aspect of both homozygous phenotypes<ul> <li>Ex: blood types (A blood, B blood, O blood, AB blood)<ol> <li>Multiple alleles and 3 possible alleles of the I gene</li> <li>Difference between blood types<ul> <li>Sugars exhibited<ol> <li>Can be linear or branched</li> <li>Such as Galactose for B</li> </ol> </li> <li>Different antibodies produced by different types (A can't mix w/ B bc of surface antibodies that would cause them to bind and coagulate.

Blood that is passing through placenta removes CO2, and the point where mother's blood and child's blood mixes, immune responses develop. The first child may be ok, but then the mother has antibodies for RH+ blood, so if second baby has O+ blood, the mother's antibodies attack it so may not survive.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Multiple alleles determine some traits (more) than two possible genes at the same locus (specific street address for a gene on a chromosome)<ul> <li>Multiple alleles can all affect same site of chromosome<ol> <li>Ex: fur color ---</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li>An individual hetero for four genes w/ a genotype of AaBbCcDd.

Not following normal pattern (3:1 phenotype). White eyed flies were usually male.

If female passes on colorblind gene, males will have it and daughters will be carriers. If female passes on good gene, no one is affected (assuming father is normal)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Epistasis = the products of different genes interact to influence the phenotype<ul> <li>One gene can interfere w/ the expression of another gene</li> <li>Ex: pigment production only occurs when a dom C allele is present. If present, AA or Aa produces brown whereas aa produces black. If rec c, that allele interferes with the expression of all other genes so that no pigment is ever produced (white)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Expression of some genes can be influenced by the environment<ul> <li>Ex: coat color in Himalayan rabbits and Siamese cats. An allele produces an enzyme (tyrosinase) that allows pigment production only at temperatures below about 33* C. Means that coat is darkest at extremities bc these are the coldest points.<ol> <li>Proteins have optimal temps and pHs at which they work</li> </ol> </li> <li>Environment can be what you eat, what you are exposed to, etc.<ol> <li>All cells must respond to environment.</li> <li>Cells can sunburn or tan depending on alleles in response to sun.

Like blending of the dom and rec genes; Ex: Shorthorn cattle - RR (red), Rr (roan), rr (white) ^1674933241172</p> <p>Incomplete dominance ratios::Genotypic ratio = 1 RR: 2 Rr: 1 rr; Phenotypic ratio = 1 red: 2 roan: 1 white ^1674933241179</p> <p>Qualitative::\"few genes\"; One or two genes involved in a trait; Ex: coat color, horned/pulled, many genetic disease phenotypes; Limited effect of env ^1674933241186</p> <p>Quantitative::\"many genes\"; Many genes, sometimes even thousands, control a trait; Ex: reproductive, milk production, growth traits; Greatly influenced by environment ^1674933241197</p> <p>G x E Interaction::Genotype by env interaction; E = everything but the genes; Ex: nutrition, housing, medical care, etc. ^1674933241204</p> <p>Epistasis (non-additive)::Interaction between non-allelic genes; Different genes determine how other genes are expressed; The phenotypic effect of genes at one locus is dependent upon what alleles are present at another locus distinct from the first locus ^1674933241210</p> <p>Ex: complete dominance epistasis in wool pigmentation of wool fibers::Alleles at one locus (W and w) control pigmentation of wool fibers; B (black) and b (brown) control pigmentation color; For pigmentation to occur, the rec allele w must be present; If individual has at least one copy of W, white wool appears (no pigmentation); F1 = BbWw (white); F2 = 9 B-W (white), 3 bbW- (white), 3 B-ww (black), 1 bbww (brown); 12:3:1 ratio of white to black to brown ^1674933241219</p> <p>Additive gene action::When the effect of one allele adds to the effect of another to determine the phenotype; Infinitesimal model of gene action ^1674933241226</p> <p>Sex-linked gene action::When genes are carried on a sex chromosome; Can be X-liked or Y-linked, dom or rec; Ex: color blindness, pattern baldness, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cat coat color, chicken feathers ^1674933241233</p> <p>Sex-limited gene action::Traits that an only be expressed by one sex; Ex: males carry traits for milk production or egg-laying but do not express them ^1674933241240</p> <p>Sex-influenced::When the expression of a trait is determined by the sex; Ex: horned is dom in male sheep but polled is dom in female sheep; Ex: scurs are dom in male cattle but rec in female cattle ^1674933241246</p> <p>[[2023-01-31]] Recessive epistasis::When homo rec interferes w/ another gene function; Ex: B = black, C = melanin production, bb = brown, cc = no melanin (albino), Hetero dihybrid cross results in 9 B-C- (black), 3 bbC- (brown), 3 B-cc (albino), 1 bbcc (albino) (9:3:4 ratio of black to brown to albino) ^1675203706956</p> <p>Incomplete dominance epistasis::Also called no dominance;

X-linked black cat + similar black cats = purebreeding; Orange cat + orange cat = purebreeding; Black cat + Orange cat = black, orange, or tortoiseshell ^1675203707060</p> <p>Tortoiseshell::Codominance of black and orange alleles in cats (Bb); Must classify kittens by sex and color; Females are torts bc of sex-linked codominance; Cats must have both black and orange alleles to be tort (occurs only in females (XBXb)) ^1675203707066</p> <p>Female tort + orange male ex::1/2 orange, 1/2 black males; 1/2 tort, 1/2 orange females ^1675203707072</p> <p>Barr bodies result in --- cats::calico; Only one X is expressed (random in each cell); Creates orange and black patches in hetero females; Piebalding effect is responsible for the expression of white fur ^1675203707077</p> <p>Recessive sex linked::Characteristic pattern of inheritance; Unaffected parents produce daughters that are normal but 50% on sons of hetero females will show recessive phenotype; Females can inherit sex-linked recessive trait, but to express, must be homo rec ^1675203707082</p> <p>Ex: colorblindness and RSL traits::XAX- = normal, XaXa = colorblind; XAY = normal, XaY = colorblind; XAY + XAXa = 50% normal, 50% colorblind males and all normal females (50% carriers, 50% normal) ^1675203707087</p> <p>Examples of sex-limited traits::Traits that can only be expressed by one sex; Milk production, Egg production, Cryptorchidism (when the testical does not descend into the scrotum) ^1675203707093</p> <p>Examples of sex-influenced traits:When the expression of a trait is determined by the sex; Ex: horned is dom in rams but polled is dom in ewes; scurs are dom in male cattle but rec in female cattle</p> <p>Pleiotropy::When one gene affects more than one trait; Leads to genetic correlation between traits (correlation also seen in gene linkage); If you select against gene A, you may end up affecting several traits ^1675203707099</p> <p>Variable expressivity::The existence of more than one grade of trait; The level of expression changes; Ex; skin color ^1675203707105</p> <p>Overdominance::Interactions between gene alleles resulting in a heterozygote that is superior to either homozygote for a particular trait; AKA Extreme heterozygote or Heterozygote advantage; Ex: SCA ^1675203707110</p> <p>Incomplete Penetrance::When not all animals w/ a particular genotype exhibit the corresponding phenotype; Not every individual that carries the gene will express the gene; Ex: Polydactyly - not every individual w/ polydactyly gene has extra toes/fingers (seen in fowl, humans, dogs, and cats) ^1675383860574</p> <p>Complete Penetrance::When every individual w/ a particular genotype exhibits the corresponding phenotype  ^1675383860584</p> <p>Lethal gene action::Results in embryonic death or death shortly after birth; Absence of the genotype/phenotype suggests that the genotype is lethal; Ex: Platinum foxes - Pp x Pp = 2 platinum: 1 silver (2 Pp: 1 pp) ^1675383860589</p> <p>Semi-lethal gene action::Results in death before puberty; Ex: Comprest (shorter dwarfism in cattle) - HH = normal, Hh = comprest (slow growth/poor development), hh = semi-lethal; Predictable ^1675383860596</p> <p>Detrimental gene action::Results in reduction in some measure of fitness or productivity; Ex: Albino Giraffe - antisocial behavior, high attrition (ease of detection) ^1675383860601</p> <p>Gene Linkage::Condition where non-allelic genes (different traits) consistently travel together through meiosis and syngamy; Leads to genetic correlation ^1675383860607</p> <p>Crossing over::Reciprocal exchange of chromosome segments between homologs; Mutual breaks occur at identical sites on each chromosome ^1675383860613</p> <p>Recombination::Formation of new combination of genes on a chromosome as a result of crossing over ^1675383860619</p> <p>The probability of recombination of genes at any two linked loci depends on the ---::distance between the loci; Crossing over occurs more often between distant genes than genes that are close together ^1675383860625</p> <p>Genes that are close together and cross over together are ---::linked ^1675383860631</p> <p>Additive gene action::The effect of one gene adds to the effect of another gene to determine the phenotype; Seen w/ quantitative traits; Expression over continuous range of values; Each gene contributes a certain amount towards phenotypic expression; Ex: Milk Production, Carcass Merit ^1675383860637</p> <p>Heritability (h^2)::The proportion of genes expected to be passed from parent to offspring that contribute to the expression of that trait; h^2 is a measure of additive gene action ^1675383860643</p> <p>Broad sense heritability::h^2 = Vg / Vp = (Vbv + Vgcv) / (Vg + Ve); Not as reliable as narrow sense heritability bc contains gene combination value; The ratio of genotypic variance to phenotypic variance  ^1675383860649</p> <p>Narrow sense heritability::h^2 = Vbv / Vp; Measure of the strength of the relationship between performance (phenotypic value) and breeding values for a trait in a population; Better to use than broad sense heritability ^1675383860654</p> <p>If a trait is highly heritable, animals w/ high performance tend to produce ---::high performing offspring and vise versa; If trait not very heritable, performance records of parents reveals little about progeny performance ^1675383860660</p> <p>Levels of heritability::High = 0.41-0.99, Medium = 0.21-0.4, Low = 0.01-0.2 ^1675383860666</p> <p>Some traits show no phenotypic differences (not heritable) even though ---::genetically determined;

Ex: Black Baldy = H x A (common beef animal in US) ^1677826246813</p> <p>Outbreeding in Swine::Extensive crossing of inbred lines and breeds to maximize repro and growth (maternal lines) ^1677826246820</p> <p>Reciprocal Recurrent Selection::System of selection for increasing the combining ability of two or more lines (or breeds) that have demonstrated from past crosses that they combine well ^1677826246826</p> <p>Reciprocal recurrent selection develops superior --- lines::inbred; Crossing more genetically diverse lines of two breeds to create superior stock ^1677826246834</p> <p>General Combining Ability (GCA)::Refers to the performance of a breed for a particular trait in a series of crosses ^1677826246848</p> <p>Ex: GCA for Angus when looking at weaning wgt::Angus x Brahman; Angus x Hereford; Angus x Limousin; Angus x Beefmaster; List weaning wgt data for multiple crosses to determine GCA of Angus ^1677826246855</p> <p>Specific Combining Ability (SCA)::Looks at a specific cross to determine the performance of a breed for a particular trait; Ex: SCA for Angus x Hereford when looking at weaning wgt ^1677826246863</p> <p>The net result of selecting parents of best performing offspring to have the next generation is the development of ---::genetically diverse inbred lines; Better performing crossed lines that express greater heterosis; Inbred lines can then be crossed w/ inbred lines of other breeds ^1677826246870</p> <p>Outbreeding in Poultry::Meat breeds use crossbreeding for growth advantages; Ex: white cornish male x white plymouth rock female (WCM has good growth and meat characterstics while WPR has good maternal characteristics) ^1677826246877</p> <p>Outbreeding in Sheep::Seen in meat breeds (down breeds like Suffolk and Hampshire); Ex: Rambouillet ewes (can breed in summer for winter lambing) x Suffolk or Hampshire rams (good growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass merit) (choice of R ewe is dictated by demands of env) ^1677826246886</p> <p>Outbreeding in Dairy::Outcrossing within breeds but rarely between breeds; Economic reason = we have established very specific parameters for value of product (H has high production but low fat while J has high fat but lower production; advantages of crossing = hybrid vigor and complementation; disadvantage = may negatively affect milk or fat w/ regard to market) ^1677826246893</p> <p>In poultry, there is extensive line-crossing w/ laying hens; Crossing egg layer by broiler (meat) won't meet either objective (doesn't improve milk or egg production)</p> <p>Wool breeds of sheep show little advantage in ---::crossbreeding; Little response to heterosis; Heritability of most wool traits is mod to high ^1677826246900</p> <p>When looking at systems of crossbreeding, we must define ---, ---, ---, and ---::objectives (traits of interest? Level of heterosis? Level of complimentary?); breeds (compatibility? Quality? Continuous supply?); herd size (larger, better the results but more costly); performance of reciprocal crosses (maternal vs paternal breed); Crossbred offspring are more expensive ^1677826246907</p> <p>When determining the performance of reciprocal crosses, look at the env and mothering ability (such as milk production); Ex: beef cattle in desert area - Male H x Female B vs Male B vs Female H; H x H = poor performance; B x B = similar performance to Male B x Female H</p> <p>Maternal swine breeds are usually ---, while paternal swine breeds are usually ---::Yorkshire, Landrace, and Chester

reliable, healthy, and economic source ^1678053351896</p> <p>Advantages of terminal system::You can produce uniform offspring; Heterosis is maximized (direct heterosis in F1 crossbred offspring); Breed complementation; Easy  ^1678053351901</p> <p>Ex of two breed terminal cross::Rambouillet ewe (maternal traits and env adaptability) x Suffolk ram (growth rate and carcass merit); Offspring go to market (none retained); Direct heterosis and complementation (but does not benefit from maternal heterosis) ^1678053351906</p> <p>In the 1950s, herefords were the dominant breed of beef cattle in the western US; Adapted to region, good demand for feeder calves; ranches began calving heifers at 2 yrs vs 3; Coupled w/ selection for bulls for growth (caused dystocia); Solution = mated first calf H heifers to angus bulls (angus known to produce low birthweight cows); But still needed H heifers as replacements so for 2nd and subsequent matings, H cows mated to H bulls (provision of desired purebred H replacement females)</p> <p>Three Breed Terminal Crosses::F1 crossbred females from two maternal breeds mated to males of sire breed (sires chosen for growth and carcass traits); Genetically superior to two breeds; Utilizes both maternal and direct heterosis; Increased breed complementation ^1678053351911</p> <p>Maternal traits include ---::Adaptability to env; High merit for reproduction; Milk production; Mothering ability ^1678053351916</p> <p>Drawback to Three Terminal Cross::Must purchase replacement females or keep separate herd for seedstock ^1678053351921</p> <p>Rotational Crossbreeding System::Involves rotating between two or more breeds; Allows production of herd replacements; Downside is that all animals are crossbred at some point ^1678053351927</p> <p>[[2023-03-06]] Two breed rotation ex::1st year - A x B = AB; 2nd yr - AB x A = AB; 3rd yr - AB x B = AB; Rotating between two breeds ^1678214721952</p> <p>Three breed rotation ex::1st yr - A x B =

system ^1678214721975</p> <p>In rotational systems, original purebred dams will be replaced by ---::crossbred descendants; Offspring and dams benefit from both direct and maternal heterosis, but not maximum potential heterosis ^1678214721983</p> <p>Rotational systems do not benefit from maximum potential heterosis (like terminal systems) bc each breed is eventually used on both --- and --- sides of the cross::female; male; Offspring always inherit some proportion of non-heterotic gene combinations ^1678214721990</p> <p>Four breed rotational systems retain more --- than two or three breed

Two equations to determine frequencies     1. HWE Definition = In a large, randomly mating population, gene/allelic and genotypic frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of mutation, migration, genetic drift, selection, and recombination.     2. Allelic frequencies: p + q = 1.0     3. Genotypic frequencies: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.0 3. Based on Mendel's principles     1. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)     2. G. H. Hardy (1877-1947)     3. Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937)     4. Hardy and Weinberg independently devised the same equation 4. In HWE, the population will be in equilibrium if not disrupted by evolutionary forces     1. Most populations do not completely follow HWE assumptions     2. Assumptions         1. No genetic drift         2. No mutation         3. No recombination         4. No selection         5. Large, sexually reproducing population     3. These are all mechanisms acting within populations, an occurrence called \"population genetics\" - except for epigenetic modifications, which act on individuals in a Lamarckian manner 5. Major Evolutionary Mechanisms in HWE     1. Requirements of HW         1. Large pop size         2. Random mating         3. No mutations         4. No migration         5. No natural selection     2. Violation of HWE (Evolution)         1. Genetic Drift         2. Inbreeding and nonrandom mating         4. Mutations         5. Migration         6. Natural Selection     3. Testing for HWE can be used to assess whether a population is evolving         1. Are you making progress w/ your crosses?         2. A pop that is not evolving shows allele and genotypic frequencies that are in HWE         3. If a pop isn't in HWE, it can be concluded that the pop is evolving              1. If evolution/change is occurring, then the frequencies will not remain constant from generation to generation     4. Population = A group of individuals within a species that is capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring         1. Interbreed + fertile offspring 6. Mathematical Description of Mendelian Inheritance     1. According to the HW principle, frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a pop remain constant from generation to generation     2. In a given pop where gametes contribute to the next generation randomly, allele frequencies will not change     3. Allelic and genotypic frequencies follow the transmission rules of Mendelian inheritance, which maintains constant proportions in a pop across generations     4. Ex: A flower pop in HWE          1. Follows Medelian frequencies when in HWE      5. If p and q represent the relative frequencies of the only two possible alleles in a pop at a locus then. . .         1. p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 7. More General HW Equations     1. One locus, three alleles: (p + q + r)^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr     2. One locus, n # alleles: (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 ... + pn)^2 + 2p1p2 + 2p1p3 + 2p1p4 + ... 2pn-1pn     3. For a polyploid (more than two chromosomes)         1. (p + q)^c where c = num of chromosomes     4. If multiple loci (genes) code for a trait, each locus follows the HW principle independently, and then the genes interact to influence the trait     5. Example - Violet, pink, and white flowers         1. Punnett square w/ both possible gametes listed and HW variables listed         2. You can preform the same calculations using percentages 8. Calculating Allele Frequencies from number of individuals     1. For diploid organisms, the total num of alleles at a locus is the total num of individuals multiplied by two     2. The total num of dom alleles at a locus is two alleles for each homo dom individual     3. Add one allele for each hetero individual         1. The same logic applies for rec individuals     4. Example         1. AA = 120, Aa = 60 and aa = 35 (number of individuals)         2. Num of A = (2 x AA) + Aa = 240 + 60 = 300         3. Num of a = (2 x aa) + Aa = 70 + 60 + 130         4. Proportion a = 130/total = 130/430 = 0.30         5. Proportion of A = 300/total = 300=430 = 0.70         6. Proportion of AA = 120/215 = 0.56         7. Proportion of Aa = 60/215 = 0.28         8. Proportion of aa = 35/215 = 0.16         9. AA + Aa + aa = 0.56 + 0.28 + 0.16 = 1.0     5. Applying the HW Principle         1. Ex: estimate frequency of a disease allele in a population             1. PKU is a metabolic disorder that results from homozygosity of rec allle                 1. Individuals that are homo rec cannot break down phenylamine, resulting in buildup and mental retardation              2. PKU = 1 per 10,000 births (frequency of disease allele)                 1. q^2 = 0.0001 so q = sqrt(0.0001) or 0.01                 2. p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99                 3. 2pq = 2(0.99)(0.01) = 0.0198 or approximately 2% of the population         2. Rare detrimental recessives often remain in a pop bc they are hidden in the hetero state (the carriers)         3. Natural selection can only act on the homozygous individuals where the phenotype is exposed (individuals who express symptoms of PKU) 9. HWE Deviation     1. Deviation from HWE indicates that evolution is happening     2. Ex: AA = 0.64, Aa = 0.32, aa = 0         1. Does not equal 1, Not in HWE         2. Could be a result of lethal gene action for homo rec     3. Any form of change in the frequency violates HWE         1. Even seemingly small degree from generation to generation 10.

Both appearance and behavior can be changed via selection ^1678924205115</p> <p>Selection::Man's most effective means to influence rate of genetic change; Allows us to use fewer animals to meet our food needs ^1678924205122</p> <p>The rate of genetic change w/ selection depends on four factors, ---::heritability (h^2), selection differential, population size, generation interval ^1678924205130</p> <p>The higher the heritability, the faster the rate of ---::change for selection; Greater h^2 = better selection ^1678924205138</p> <p>Selection Differential::The mean value of selected individuals minus the mean value of the pop from which they were selected; X (individual) - mean of X (pop) ^1678924205146</p> <p>The larger the selection differential, the --- rate of change through selection::faster; We select for extremes (greater differential) ^1678924205154</p> <p>The greater the population size, the greater the ---::superiority for selection; Results in greater variation so more potential for genetic progress; Variation is the raw material for selection ^1678924205162</p> <p>Generation interval::The avg number of years for turnover of a pop; Shorter = better for selection ^1678924205169</p> <p>The smaller the generation interval, the --- the rate of change through selection::faster ^1678924205176</p> <p>Gi Ex::If male is 24 and female is 22 by the time they have their first child, then the avg generation interval is 23 years  ^1678924205184</p> <p>Basis for Selection (Sources of Info)::Individual performance records, Pedigree, Collateral relatives, and Progeny; Must be accurate data ^1678924205191</p> <p>When you select a sire and dam, you are selecting them out of the pop w/ a ---::goal to change the pop over time; May use various sources of accurate info as your basis of selection  ^1678924205199</p> <p>Individual performance records::Direct measuring of the animals of interest; Can record yourself; Most commonly used as a source of info for selection ^1678924205206</p> <p>The value of individual performance is highly related to ---::h^2; Very good for highly heritable traits (ex growth traits such as WW, YW, ADG, and FE; carcass traits such as IMF, FT, and REA, and milk production traits such as MY, MF, and P%) ^1678924205213</p> <p>Disadvantages of using individual performance records as basis for selection::Not good for sex limited traits (ex can't measure a bull for MY); Can't rely on individual performance for traits that require long time to appear (ex puberty); Can't measure carcass traits where animal must be slaughtered to take measurements; Low accuracy for lowly h^2 traits ^1678924205220</p> <p>Pedigree (basis for selection)::Looking at ancestors to make predictions; How did the parents perform? ^1678924205226</p> <p>Collateral relatives (basis for selection)::Looking at performance of siblings (ex how are related females performing?); Can look at both full and half siblings ^1678924205233</p> <p>Progeny (basis for selection)::The best way to measure the genetic worth of an animal ^1678924205240</p> <p>Accuracy of Selection::The relative reliability of estimates that we are using to make selection decisions ^1678924205248</p> <p>Statistically speaking, the accuracy of selection estimates how accurately the genotype of the individual for a certain trait can be predicted from  ---::the phenotypic averages of its relatives ^1678924205255</p> <p>The level of accuracy does not suggest the --- of an animal::net worth ^1678924205261</p> <p>The accuracy of estimates will --- over time::change;

Bar X = mean of pop ^1678924205282</p> <p>Why divide by two when estimating breeding value?::Half of genetic potential from animal X; Each parent contributes half to the next generation ^1678924205289</p> <p>Ex: Post Weaning ADG::Must look at. . .h^2 (0.6), Selection differential (x - mx); Pop size; Gi; EPV = 0.6(3.5 - 3.0) / 2 = 0.15; EPD = 0.15 + 3.0 = 3.15; Gi = 0.15/5 = 0.03 lb/yr; Accuracy = sqrt(0.6) = 0.77 ^1678924205295</p> <p>Estimated Progeny Different::Different of progeny in comparison to avg of pop;

Involves degree of relationship, h^2 of trait, Same env; Same methods to measure traits ^1678924205333</p> <p>Degree of relationship when considering pedigrees::Parents = 1/2, Grandparents = 1/4, Great Grandparents = 1/8, As you move further up the pedigree, amount of genes in common reduces and they are less related ^1678924205340</p> <p>When using pedigree as basis of selection, traits must be ---::measured in same way as ancestor; Ex: heart guard (circumference of heart) must be measuring in same spot in parent as in offspring ^1678924205348</p> <p>[[2023-03-17]] Advantages of Pedigree (basis of selection)::Cheap; Valuable for sex-limited traits (unlike IP) and traits expressed later in life;

No comparative basis for selection among individuals that are all descendants of the same ancestor  ^1679084988093</p> <p>Looking at pedigrees provides no comparative basis for selection among individuals that are all descendants of the same ancestor (like siblings) bc ---::they are expected to all have equal performance (not usually the case) ^1679084988099</p> <p>Collateral Relatives::Using info from full sibs (same parents) or half sibs (one parent in common); More useful when dealing w/ full sibs ^1679084988106</p> <p>Full sibs = --- related while half sibs = --- related::1/2; 1/4; Accuracy better if they share mother vs. father; Accuracy better if full ^1679084988113</p> <p>Advantages of Collateral Relatives (basis of selection)::Good for sex-limited traits and traits that require slaughter to measure ^1679084988120</p> <p>Accuracy when looking at collateral relatives tends to be lower than ---::individual performance; Exception = low h^2 traits bc increased num of observations ^1679084988126</p> <p>Factors affecting accuracy of sib test (collateral relatives)::h^2 of trait; Relationship of sib (closeness); Number of sibs tested; Correlation between phenotypes of sibs ^1679084988134</p> <p>Accuracy of collateral relatives is higher w/ more --- and in --- sibs::sibs tested; full ^1679084988140</p> <p>Correlation between phenotypes of sibs affects --- info::collateral relative;

Looking at the performance of the progeny to rank the parents ^1679084988163</p> <p>The best answer to the question of \"genetic worth\" of an animal is determined by --- testing::progeny; For both qualitative and quantitative traits ^1679084988170</p> <p>[[2023-03-20]] Progeny Testing w/ Qualitative Traits::Main objective = determine the likelihood that an animal is a carrier of a detrimental recessive allele ^1679344032027</p> <p>Progeny Testing Ex: CID in Arabians::CID = combined immunodeficiency (AKA SID); In foals, passive immunity from mother wears off and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs) is meant to turn on foal's IS; IN CID, this malfunctions so foal gets infection and dies (lethal) ^1679344032034</p> <p>CID is an autosomal --- trait::recessive; Both parents must be hetero for offspring to express this; We use locus test to prevent this; Causes foal to be susceptible to infection as maternal Ab wanes (&gt;2 months, Ig levels decrease -&gt; infection -&gt; death) ^1679344032040</p> <p>Factors affecting the \"success\" of progeny test for qualitative traits::Genetic make-up of test animal (genotypes available); Num of offspring that can be produce (more = better) ^1679344032046</p> <p>Test Matings::Number of offspring required to determine the likelihood that an animal is not a carrier of a detrimental trait depends on type of potential cross ^1679344032051</p> <p>When using test matings to determine likelihood that a parent is a carrier of a detrimental recessive allele, the more offspring, the ---::greater confidence that animal is not a carrier ^1679344032056</p> <p>Sire x recessive (H_ x hh) Test Mating::Advantage = fewer matings required; Disadvantage = can be difficult to find homo rec dams ^1679344032062</p> <p>Sire x heterozygote (H_ x H_) Test Mating::Advantage = dam is known carrier; Disadvantage = Must ID animals and more matings involved ^1679344032067</p> <p>Sire x daughter Test Mating (H_ x H_)::Advantage = easier to obtain dam; Disadvantage = inbreeding depression and many progeny required ^1679344032072</p> <p>Test Matings Graph:: ^1679351897839</p> <p>Progeny Testing w/ Quantitative Traits::Major objective = determining BV of parents ^1679351897850</p> <p>Offspring represent --- BV of parents::1/2; Basis for EPDs and EBVs; EBV = (h^2(x - mx)) / 2; EPD = EBV + mx ^1679351897856</p> <p>EBV Equation::EBV = (h^2(x-mx)) / 2 ^1679351897863</p> <p>EPD Equation::EPD = EBV + mx ^1679351897868</p> <p>Factors Affecting Accuracy of Progeny Testing for Quantitative Traits::Dams must be random; Offspring must be tested in the same env; Must compare parents of similar ages (another factor of env); Increased num of progeny = increased accuracy ^1679351897874</p> <p>When Progeny Testing, offspring must be tested in same ---::env; Performance = G + E; Env is anything apart from genes; Must control for G x E interactions ^1679351897880</p> <p>As h^2 increases, more progeny in PT required to equal accuracy of ---::individual performance; PT is better w/ low-mod h^2 while IP better w/ high h^2 ^1679351897886</p> <p>The net value of an animal is dependent upon several traits that may not be of ---::equal economic value; May also be independent of one another (or even inverse relationship such as MY and MF) ^1679351897893</p> <p>Three basic methods for Selection for More than One Trait::Tandem (not used); Independent Culling Method (less used); Selection Index (most used) ^1679351897899</p> <p>Selection for More than One Trait Ex: both BW and YW::Want BW to be low but YW to be high; Not possible to buy bull based on one single trait; But these traits may not be of equal economic value ^1679351897906</p> <p>Tandem Method (&gt;1 trait selection)::Allows you to focus on one trait at a time; Ex: may select for BW until you have animal w/ consistently low BW then begin to select for another trait; Old, inefficient method ^1679351897913</p> <p>The tandem method involves selection for one trait, then ---::another, then switch focus to another. . . ^1679351897919</p> <p>Problems w/ Tandem Method::May have opposing genetic relationship between traits; More traits = slower progress; Takes a long time ^1679351897925</p> <p>Independent Culling Method::Still being used, but has stringent rules so may not provide the best animal overall; Creation of min standards and select for only those standards (culled if animal below min in any trait) ^1679351897932</p> <p>Problem w/ Independent Culling Method::If animal fails one standard, must be culled; You may cull animals that are outstanding in other traits ^1679351897938</p> <p>For a pig to be saved for breeding in ICM, must meet three standards: ---::1 - litter of &gt;= 8 weaned; 2 - Weight &gt;180 lbs at 5 months; 3 - &lt;= 1.3 in of backfat at 200 lbs live weight ^1679351897945</p> <p>Selection Index::Creates an index w/ weighted averages (like GPA for the animals); Some traits get more points (weight) than other traits (different degrees of emphasis on traits of interest); Then you make equation to determine genetic worth ^1679351897951</p> <p>Selection Indexes create separate determination of values for each ---::selection trait; The addition of these values gives a total score ^1679351897957</p> <p>The most widely used selection method for &gt;1 trait is ---::selection index ^1679351897963</p> <p>Selection Index Equation::I = b1x1 + b2x2 + . . . bnxn;

Or IP is 4% better than PT ^1679352313671</p> <p>Looking at sibs is more accurate than IP if ---::low h^2 ^1679352313678</p> <p>The relative accuracy (compared to IP) of one full sib is --- regardless of ---::0.5; h^2 ^1679352313685</p> <p>[[2023-03-21]] Selection Index Ex: Beef producer - cow/calf stocker::WW = 0.4 (500 and 200); Post ADG = 0.3 (.25 and 0.75); YW = 0.3 (1000 and 300); But must be put on trait ratio basis; 100 = heard avg and x/mx  x 100 = trait ratio ^1679442492946</p> <p>The selection index refers to a single number that predicts the ---::BV of an individual for a weighted combination of traits  ^1679442492956</p> <p>Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP)::An extension of SI;

derived species; Important for ancestor but no longer important for derived species; Ex: pelvic girdle in snakes/whales ^1673883490356</p> <p>All living organisms have ---::DNA; Main holder of genetic info; DNA --&gt; RNA --&gt; Protein; Unifying factor of all life ^1673883490363</p> <p>Cytochrome-c protein::Cytochrome is used for the ETC; Similar AA in eukaryotes (monkeys are 1AA different from

from changes in genetic composition over generations at a populational level; Individual change is growth/development ^1673883490387</p> <p>Misconception: Evolution is a theory tied to origin of life::Does not directly relate to origin of life questions; Genetics must already be in population for evolution ^1673883490393</p> <p>Misconception: Transitional fossils remain unknown; Well-known to scientists bc fossilization is rare; Most fossils that would fill in gaps will likely remain unknown</p> <p>Misconception: Organisms evolve on purpose; Individuals do not evolve, but a population over generations might; The adaptive trait already exists in a population and natural selection then acts</p> <p>Misconception: Random chance alone guides evolution::Chance is only a part of evolution of complex traits over time; Mutations occur randomly but selection does not occur randomly ^1673883490399</p> <p>Misconception: Evolution is not testable::By definition, it has been tested/retested 100s of times; Genetics and DNA technology has provided robust evidence ^1673883490405</p> <p>Misconception: Humans evolved directly from apes::Humans (Homo sapiens) share an ancestor w/ modern apes;

limitation of the species definition ^1674164454227</p> <p>Limitations of biological species definition::Limited to reproductive definition (species shouldn't interbreed) but  hybrids may routinely occur naturally; Also does not apply to asexual reproducers ^1674164454231</p> <p>Speciation::The formation of two species from one; Allopatric (\"other homeland\") or sympatric (\"same homeland\") ^1674164454234</p> <p>Allopatric speciation::Occurs due to geographic isolation; Ex: lake water level drops, river forms as a barrier; Two new species result from geographic barriers ^1674164454238</p> <p>Adaptive radiation (bio)::Quick expansion of one species into many species to fit new/different environmental conditions and niches; Ex: finches ^1674164499773</p> <p>The mosquitofish exhibits --- speciation::allopatric; A barrier formed separating the mosquitofish; They experienced different pressures in different ponds as one had a predator and other didn't; Deep body depth developed for burst swimming to get away from predators; Long body depth developed for steady swimming in those w/ no predators ^1674164454241</p> <p>The snapping shrimp exhibits --- speciation::allopatric; The isthmus of Panama formed gradually from 10 to 3 mya, separating the Atlantic from the Pacific; About 15 spp formed on Atlantic side and about 15 on Pacific side; Sister species in similar habitats that arose due to geographic barrier ^1674164454245</p> <p>Sympatric speciation::When two new species result within the same area (no geographic isolation); Gene flow may

^1674164454252</p> <p>An autopolyploid condition can occur from a ---::cell division error; Ex: tetraploid cells must self-pollinate because they are isolated from other 2N plants (yields new species); Sympatric S. ^1674164454255</p> <p>An allopolyploid condition results from ---::interbreeding species w/ different numbers of chromosome sets; Allopolyploid hybrids are often sterile but can undergo asexual reproduction (may later become fertile, create new species, and breed w/ each other); Sympatric S. ^1674164454258</p> <p>Allopolyploid Ex (Sympatric S.)::Normal gamete from species A (n = 3) + Normal gamete from species B (n = 2) --&gt; sexually sterile hybrid zygote (n = 5) ^1674164454261</p> <p>Sexual selection (Sympatric S.)::Two different species often mate at different times of year or may use different colors, rituals, etc; Prevents mating of different species ^1674164454265</p> <p>Lake Victoria cichlids exemplify ---::sexual selection; Speciation occurred 100,000 ya; Females select males of their own species (males differ by color in different light spectrums); Prevents cross-mating ^1674164454268</p> <p>Habitat differentiation (Sympatric S.)::Different sub populations of species may exploit different resources, preventing crossing of their species ^1674164454271</p> <p>Apple vs Blueberry maggot flies exhibit ---::habitat differentiation; Apple maggots are attracted to different food resources than blueberry maggots; Apples also develop faster (ex of temporal isolation as well) ^1674164454274</p> <p>Prezygotic barriers include ---::habitat isolation, temporal isolation, behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation, and gametic isolation; Prezygotic = before the zygote ^1674164454278</p> <p>Habitat isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Two species live in two different habitats within the same area, but encounters are rare; Prevents mating; Ex: Apple vs blueberry maggots ^1674164454281</p> <p>Temporal isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Different species have different seasonality of breeding (day/night, spring/fall, etc.); Prevents mating; Ex: Spilogale spp (Western skunks breed in summer while Eastern breed in winter) ^1674164454285</p> <p>Behavioral isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Different courtship rituals between species prevents mating; Male mating displays differ; Ex: many different Birds of Paradise (44 spp) w/ highly diverse dances ^1674164454288</p> <p>Mechanical isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Mating may be attempted between different species but mismatched copulation; Prevents fertilization; Ex: Bradybaena spp (snail shell spirals &amp; genital openings); Misalignment prevents exchange ^1674164454292</p> <p>Gametic isolation (prezygotic barrier)::Disparate morphology of sperm between species serves as a physical or biochemical barrier; Even when multiple sperm or eggs are around, they don't fertilize one another (just match to species); Prevents fertilization; Ex: Strongylocentrotus spp. broadcasts spawning of gametes w/ purple &amp; red urchin sperm protein but despite many gametes around, cross-fertilization does not occur ^1674164454295</p> <p>Postzygotic barriers include ---::reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, or hybrid breakdown; Fertilization occurs and zygote forms, but hybrids do not last ^1674164454299</p> <p>Reduced hybrid viability (postzygotic barrier)::Survivability of the hybrid is low; Ex: Ensantina spp (salamander hybrids fail to completely develop after zygote formation) ^1674164454302</p> <p>Reduced hybrid fertility (postzygotic barrier)::Individual hybrids are sterile bc their chromosomal number differs; Ex: donkey (m w/ 62 chromosomes) + horse (f w/ 64 chromosomes) = mule (w/ 63 chromosomes but no fertility) ^1674164454306</p> <p>Hybrid breakdown (postzygotic barrier)::When the 1st hybrid generation may be fertile but subsequent generations are not; Ex: rice hybrids carry a recessive allele and new generations accumulate the recessive allele so that the next generation is small/sterile ^1674164454309</p> <p>Hybrid zones::The overlap of species where they can interact ^1674164454312</p> <p>Hybrid zone patterns::Spatially explicit overlap zone; Patches vs boundary overlap; Alleles change within the hybrid zone; Ex: yellow and fire-bellied toads (near 100% of YB or FB at edges; as hybrids develop in the zone, problems occur and hybrid does not last long enough for specification) ^1674164454315</p> <p>The environment and hybrid zones::Climate change shifts zones; Ex: S. and N. flying squirrel ranges never overlapped before, but a recent shift of Southern squirrels moving northward has caused ranges to naturally overlap now (may provide buffer to climate change if hybrid better suited to change - hybrid \"vigor\") ^1674164454319</p> <p>When the sharing of genetics creates a hybrid that is better suited to the environment than the parent species, it is called ---::hybrid vigor; hybrid may outcompete parental species in that area ^1674164454322</p> <p>What may occur w/ hybrids?::Hybrids could form due to a temporary reconnection; Reestablished gene flow is possible; Real-time speciation may be observed w/ hybrids today ^1674164454325</p> <p>Reinforcement involves the strengthening of ---::reproductive barriers; Ex: European and collared fly-catcher females select male mates. W/ allopatric separation, males of both species appear similar (if mixing occurs again, confusion may occur); W/ sympatric separation, males are distinct (more reinforcement within sympatric) ^1674164454328</p> <p>Natural selection is the agent of ---::change ^1674250492545</p> <p>Fusion involves the weakening of ---::reproductive barriers; Gene pools become increasingly alike, speciation reverses, and biodiversity goes down; Ex: Bull trout is threatened western species while brook trout is introduced eastern species into the west (brooks outcompeting and hybridizing w/ bull; hybrid may further stress bull trout) ^1674164454335</p> <p>Stability involves the continued formation of ---::hybrid individuals; Ex: YB and RB toads both routinely enter the hybrid zone and consistent hybrid zone forms (true regardless of low hybrid success); A narrow zone increases mating chances while a wider zone decreases hybrid numbers so the zone expands and shrinks (stability overall) ^1674164454338</p> <p>The avg time for speciation is ---::6.5 my; Shortest = 4000 y and Longest = 40 my; Depends on persistence and cataclysm; Described in fossils and DNA ^1674164454341</p> <p>Punctuated Model of Speciation::Short speciation period followed by prolonged stabilization;

Individuals don't look identical, and on a less overt level, enzymes and proteins vary; Ex: feral horse populations (coloration differences in mustangs) ^1674336733281</p> <p>Phenotypic variation can be caused by --- genes::single or multiple; Could be single difference, but more likely multiple genes are involved in the expression of the phenotype ^1674336733294</p> <p>Natural selection applies pressure on ---::mutations (random mutations --&gt;

Genes become more common over generations due to changes in environment; Ex: random natural disaster kills off black hares so brown hares become the dominant population ^1674336733309</p> <p>Gene flow occurs when ---::new alleles enter the population; Emigration of new genes to a new location; New phenotypes in new generations ^1674336733315</p> <p>Gene variability refers to the proportion of ---::zygosity; Whole-gene level variation; Ex: 14% of fly pop is hetero while 84% is homo ^1674336733323</p> <p>Nucleotide variability refers to the ---::molecular variation in DNA; Most variations do not equal change in phenotype (could be mutation within an intron or AA redundancy); One change could be significant however (ex SCA) ^1674336733330</p> <p>Nonheritable variation::Acquired traits cannot be passed; Cannot change phenotype to change genotype (refutes Lamarck's ideas); Ex: body builders do not produce muscular offspring (ability to gain mass could be passed on but not phenotype itself) ^1674336733338</p> <p>Sources of genetic variation include ---::new (mutant) alleles, neutral variation, gene number/position, rapid reproduction, and sexual reproduction ^1674336733344</p> <p>New (mutant) alleles can increase genetic variation, but many are ---::detrimental; Heterozygote could protect against detrimental allele (ex hetero advantage and SCA); May become important later for the species ^1674336733351</p> <p>Neutral variation has no observed ---::affect/advantage; Could be related to non-coding DNA redundancy in codons, or new amino acid still keeps protein functional ^1674336733358</p> <p>Gene number/position can increase genetic variation if a gene ---::translocates (large translocation usually bad but small could be good depending on environment); May accumulate through time if beneficial; Ex: initially only one olfactory gene in vertebrates but duplicated many times ^1674336733365</p> <p>Rapid reproduction can increase genetic variation, especially in ---::prokaryotes and viruses (able to reproduce very rapidly compared to eukaryotes); Quick generation time increases likelihood of mutations (Ex: HIV resistance) ^1674336733374</p> <p>Eukaryotic organisms have low ---::mutation rates compared to prokaryotes (1 in 100,000 genes per generation); Means that DNA replication is working; ON an individual level, this is good for eukaryotes ^1674336733383</p> <p>Sexual Reproduction is a source of genetic variation due to ---::shuffling of alleles, crossing over in P1, independent assortment in M1, and random fertilization (Ndad + Nmom = 2Nz) ^1674336733390</p> <p>Microevolution is --- evolution that affects populations (not individuals)::\"small scale\"; Genes + Env = Expressed Traits; Change in allele frequency in pop through time ^1674336733397</p> <p>We can track the alleles and genotypes in the ---::gene pool (all the alleles in a population) using the equation p + q = 1.0; Phenotypes inform genotypes and vise versa ^1674336733404</p> <p>p + q = 1.0::Frequency of dominant allele (p) plus frequency of recessive allele (q) should equal one (the entire gene pool) ^1674336733411</p> <p>Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium::p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.0 (genotype frequencies from allelic frequencies; pheno frequencies can be derived from that); p2 = homo dom frequency; 2pq = hetero frequency; q2 = homo rec frequency ^1674336733418</p> <p>The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium only follows ---::Mendelian inheritance in a non-evolving, random mating, and large, sexually-reproducing population  ^1674336733425</p> <p>The HWE is only true if ---::no mutations, no migration, large gene pool, random mating, no selection; In realistic terms, the pop is likely evolving and these conditions are not true; Serves as an initial test of evolution on the population ^1674336733433</p> <p>Ex of HWE::Representative subsample = 25 moths (50 alleles); p (dom alleles) = 10 &amp; q (rec alleles) = 40 so p = 0.20 and q = 0.80 (0.20 + 0.80 - 1.0); HWE = (0.20)^2 + 2(0.20)(0.80) + (0.80)^2 = 1.0 (p2 = 0.04, pq = 0.32, q = 0.64); Most of pop is light-colored so favored selection for light colored moths ^1674336733439</p> <p>[[2023-01-24]] Pepper moths cling to tree trunks, and prior to the industrial revolution, the trees were ---::white; Birds readily consumed dark moths (light (dd) was better for camo); Post industrial revolution - moths alleles changed from 1800s into late 1900s as burning coal put soot on trees (dark became desirable); Then industry regulations limited soot so moths avg eventually became light again ^1674594131891</p> <p>Genetic Drift::Change in alleles by chance through random events; Changes not linked w/ evolution and occurs regardless of genotype or phenotype (so great an event that changes occur indiscriminately) ^1674594131901</p> <p>Ex of genetic drift::Population could end up w/ more brown rabbits bc they were farther away from volcano than black rabbits ^1674594131908</p> <p>Founder effect::When a few individuals leave populations to another area; Could be difficult to get population started in new area; Once reproduction does occur, an established population may develop; Limited gene pool initially (adaptability is restricted by small gene pool) ^1674594131914</p> <p>When a few individuals leave the populations, they often carry over ---::recessive traits; Founder effect; Could be detrimental, but so little genetic variation that population is susceptible to maladaptive traits; homozygosity and inbreeding ^1674594131920</p> <p>Genetic bottleneck::Refers to small fragmented populations; Populations could be isolated by something as seemingly insignificant as a road; Limited genetic diversity (gene pool and adaptability is restricted; homozygosity and inbreeding) ^1674594131926</p> <p>Consequences of Genetic Drift::Significant in small populations but observed in all populations; Goes against HW principle assumption bc allelic frequency may change at random (yr-to-yr variation does not indicate evolution); Loss of genetic variation within pop (habitat fragmentation, less resistant to env change);

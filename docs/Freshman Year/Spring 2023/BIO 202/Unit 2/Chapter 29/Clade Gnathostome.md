1. Jawed vertebrates
	1. Name = "jaw mouth"
	2. Hinged structure that is attached to the skull
	3. Can grasp and tear food
	4. Derived from the 1st gill arch
2. Two sets of pared fins
	1. Pectoral (anterior)
	2. Pelvic (posterior)
3. Quick diversity radiation
	1. Began w/ Acanthodians
		1. Spiny sharks
		2. Rigid dorsal, pelvic, and pectoral spines
		3. Extinct
	2. Placoderm
		1. ---
		2. Extinct
	3. Chondrichthyes
		1. Cartilagous fish
		2. Like shark
	4. Osteichthyes
		1. ---
	5. Tetrapods
4. Gnathostome Fishes
	1. Vertebral Column
		1. Cartilaginous (calcified)
			1. Don't fossilize well 
		2. Ossified 
		3. Includes tetrapods
	2. Internal gills (all)
		1. Respiration
		2. Most efficient way to take O2 out of water
	3. Two-chambered heart
		1. Single-loop circulation
		2. Prevents oxygenized blood and nonoxygenated blood from mixing
	4. Most are ectothermic
		1. Biological processes are dependent upon outside temperature
		2. Colloquially called cold-blooded
	5. Reproduction notes
		1. Internal vs External fertilization
			1. Do eggs develop inside or outside?
			2. Most are external, but some such as sharks are external 
		2. Internal vs. External development
5. Class Chondrichthyes
	1. Phylogenetics
		1. ---
		2. Phylum Chordata -> Subphylum Vertebrata -> Class Chondrichthyes
		3. Clade Gnathostome
	2. Cartilaginous fishes
		1. Cartilage skeleton
		2. W/ CaCO3
		3. Does not fossilize well
	3. Class characteristics
		1. Placoid scales
			1. "skin-teeth"
			2. Oriented from head to tail
			3. Help with hydrodynamics but also protect (sharp like teeth)
		2. Specialized teeth
			1. Scales -> teeth over time
		3. Lateral line
			1. Helps them sense water displacement
		4. Ampullae of Lorenzini
			1. Jelly-filled pores in the nose
			2. Allows them to sense electrical currents down to mV
				1. Can sense heartbeats
			3. All cartilaginous fish have this but most bony fish do not
		5. Large liver
			1. 25% of BM
		6. Heterocercal tail 
			1. One part is much larger than the other
			2. Upper lobe is biggest
				1. Vertebral column extends into the upper lobe
	4. Major groups
		1. Chimaeras
			1. The rat fish
		2. Sharks
		3. Skates & Rays
			1. Two largest orders 
			2. Skates have clear pelvic vs pectoral fins
	5. Ecology and Repro
		1. Mostly marine, Few FW
			1. Bull shark (both)
		2. Carnivores
			1. Teeth morphed to feeding strategy
		3. Oviparous = laying eggs
		4. Ovovivious = having eggs that attach internally
		5. Viviparous = live birth
		6. Sharks exhibit all ovi-, ovovivi-, and vivi-
		7. Oophagy
			1. Egg eater
			2. In some sharks, some eggs eat the other eggs while inside the mother
			3. Down from dozens to one dozen
			4. Ex: sand tiger, lemon sharks, great white

8. [[Clade Amniotes]]

^1663447019553

Chicken reproductive info::No Estrous cycle; No Estrus; Time of ovulation is 6am-2pm; No Gestation; Clutch 5-10 Offspring
^1663447019560

Duplex::Marsupials and rodents; Two cervices
^1663447019567

Bicornuate::Livestock, dogs, cats; Poorly to moderately developed uterine horns in mares and cows but highly developed in bitches, queens, and sows; Two ovaries, two oviducts, a single cervix, two uterine horns, a uterine body, a vagina
^1663447019573

Simplex::Humans, primates; No uterine horns
^1663447019580

Ovary::Exocrine function (ovum production and ovulation); Endocrine function (hormone production)
^1663447019587

After a follicle grows and and animal goes into estrus ---- occurs::exocrine (production and release of ovum)
^1663447019594

Hormones::Chemical signals that are designed to travel through circulatory system for communication (controlled by nervous system (faster) or endocrine system (slower))
^1663447019601

Estrogen (E2)::"Hormone of Estrus" (Involved w/ physiological and behavior changes that prepare for sperm transport and fertilization); From follicle cells
^1663447019607

Testosterone (T)::Required for ovum development; From follicle cells
^1663447019614

Corpus Luteum::"Yellow body"; Develops from cells of follicle after ovulation; Produces Progesterone (P4)
^1663447019621

Progesterone (P4)::"Hormone of pregnancy" (Prepares reproductive track for gestation); From corpus luteum
^1663447019628

 Estrous cycle ex::If a cow's cycle is 210 days, first the follicle grows and produces estrogen until it peaks and ovulation occurs (which breaks the follicle). Then, the corpus luteum grows and produces P4. If animal not pregnant, the corpus luteum and P4 goes away, follicle starts regrowing, and cycle restarts.
^1663447019635

"Follicle wars"::Cows have multiple follicles, but only one ends up ovulation
^1663447019642

Oviduct::Between ovaries and uterotubial junction; Also called fallopian tubes; Important for transport of both the ovum and sperm; Site of fertilization; Also provides nutrition fluid for embryo while in transport to uterus
^1663447019649

Fertilization occurs in the ---::infundibulum (top of oviduct funnel from ovaries)
^1663447019656

[[2022-09-22]]
Uterus::Transport (Help sperm get from uterine body to oviduct by smooth muscle contractions); Parturition process (very powerful smooth muscle contractions); Nutrition (Provides embryo nutrients called uterine milk until placental attachment); Site of gestation (involves placental attachment); Endocrine hormones
^1663887923828

In most species, sperm are deposited in --- and get up to the oviduct with aid from the ---::vagina; uterus; Pigs are exception as sperm deposited in uterine body
^1663887923833

Placental attachment::Embryonic tissues to attachment of uterine wall
^1663887923836

Cervix::Protects the uterine environment from potential pathogens; Contains folds that makes it easier to get things out than in; Located below uterine horns and only opens during estrus (during which it produces high amounts of mucus for lubrication and flushing microbes) and parturition (dilation indicates how close parturition is)
^1663887923840

Vagina::Place of semen deposition in most species (exception is swine, which is deposited in uterus); Located under cervix; Also provides removal of urine; Tough internal tissues
^1663887923843

Ovary sum::Exocrine (ovum production) and endocrine (E2, T, P4)
^1663887923847

Oviduct sum::Transportation, Fertilization site, Nutrition
^1663887923850

Uterus (Horns and Body) sum::Transportation, Nutrition for embryo, Site of gestation (placental attachment), and endocrine functions (several hormones)
^1663887923854

Cervix sum::Physical barrier
^1663887923857

Vagina sum::Semen deposition (except swine)
^1663887923861

Sperm and ovum are both ---::haploid (half the chromosomes); Embryo is diploid
^1663887923864

Ovum has a ---::zona pelluie (shell) that sperm combines w/ to create embryo
^1663887923868

Embryo::Starts dividing (cells get smaller as they divide); Cells begin to specialize; The zona pelluiea surrounds the inner cell mass; Tripoplast cells within shell eventually break out as placenta
^1663887923871

Placenta::Has several layers; Amnion (inner), Chorion (middle), and Allantois (outer); Chorioallantois (fused layers of placenta making up sac); Amnionic sac (makes up inner sac); Attached to internal organism by ambilocal cord; Uterine wall surrounds it all
^1663887923874

Placenta functions::Exchange of products, Hydraulic dampener, Cervical dilation and lubrication during parturition
^1663887923878

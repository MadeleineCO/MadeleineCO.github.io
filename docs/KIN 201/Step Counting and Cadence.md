1. You've probably heard about the 10,000 steps/day goal. . .
	- This is probably too much for older/diseased individuals (7,000-10,000 steps)
	- This is probably not enough for children (11,000-13,000)
2. Research in this area comes from big studies w/ lots of participants using pedometers and assessing health/fitness outcomes
3. Physical Activity Categories
	- 5,000 steps/day = sedentary
		1. Increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes
	- 5,000-7,500 steps/day = low activity
		1. Usual daily activities
		2. This is avg num of steps people take in a day without exercising
	- 7,500-10,000 steps/day = somewhat active
		1. Some volitional exercise, or unusually high physical activity job demands
	- >10,000 steps/day = active
4. Very generic 
	- Doesn't include other forms of exercise
5. Why is 10,000 steps the target?
	- Research and a little bit of psychology
	- 5,000-7,500 steps/day come from "usual daily activities"
	- A 30 min walk (moderate intensity for many people) will require about 3,000-4,000 steps
	- So, normal daily activities + a 30 min of exercise is 8,000-11,500 steps
		1. But the 10,000 num is super easy for people to remember
6. Cadence
	- Steps/min determines intensity of walking 
	- For many people, ~100 steps/min is the min threshold for moderate intensity activity
	- 100 steps/min x 30 min of walking = 3,000 steps
7. Average American
	- 4.8 hrs/day = 0 steps/min
	- 8.7 hrs /day = 1-59 steps/min
	- 16 min/day = >59 steps/min

1. Atria ("stretchy")
	1. Collect blood that is returning from the heart
2. Atrioventricular valves
	1. Atria -> ventricle
	2. Tricuspid (RA -> RV)
	3. ---
3. Veins -> to heart
	1. Usually deoxygenated
4. Arteries -> away from heart
	1. Usually oxygenated
5. Ventricles ("muscular")
	1. Contractions move blood away
6. Semilunar valves
	1. Ventricles -> vessels
	2. Pulmonary (RV -> PA)
	3. Aortic (LV -> Aorta)
7. Heart rate
	1. Regulated by SA node
	2. Automatic ---
8. Contraction of the Heart
	1. Atria
		1. Right (body)
		2. Left (lungs)
		3. Pressure up = AVs open
			1. As blood fills atria, pressure increases so atrioventricular valves open
		4. Blood -> ventricles (80% of blood)
		5. Atria contracts (20% of blood)
		6. Fills relaxed ventricles (*diastole*)
	2. Ventricles
		1. Contract (*systole*)
		2. AV forcibly close (LUB)
		3. Pressure up, SLs open
		4. Blood -> vessels
		5. Relaxation
		6. SL close (DUB)
9. Electrical Excitation
	1. Heart at rest (no stimulus)
	2. Sinoatrial node fires 
		1. Action potentials spread through atria
		2. Atria contract (last 20% of blood)
		3. Action potentials spread to AV-node
	3. Atrioventricular node fires
		1. Stimulated by SA action potential
		2. Impulses down myoseptum
		3. Causes ventricles to contract
	4. ---
	5. Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)
		1. P-wave 
			1. Atrial contraction
			2. Atrial depolarization
		2. QRS complex
			1. Systole (120 mmHg)
			2. Ventricular contraction
			3. Ventricular depolarization
		3. T-wave
			1. Distole (80 mmHg)
			2. Ventricular relaxation
			3. Ventricular repolarization
			4. The anode location flips the signal so that the T-wave appears like its positive on the EKG when it's really more negative

10. Regulation of Heart Rate
	1. SA is local control
	2. Increase heart rate
		1. Cardioaccelerator
		2. Norepinephrine
		3. Sympathetic 
	3. Decrease heart rate
		1. Cardioinhibitory
		2. Acetylcholine
		3. Parasympathetic

11. Regulation of Blood Pressure
	1. Baroreceptors (aortic arch and carotid arteries)
	2. Dehydration increases blood pressure by thickening blood
	3. Stimuli can cause responses in negative feedback loops
	4. Graphic

12. Cardiovascular Disease
	1. Atherosclerosis
		1. High blood pressure and high cholesterol
			1. Can be genetic, high sodium diet, etc.
		2. Plaque formation causse vessel blockage
			1. If heart cannot get blood, tissue dies
		3. "Bypass" surgery
			1. Bypasses blocked arteries
	2. Congestive fluid surrounds heart and can cause congestive heart failure
		1. Stints allow fluid to drain 
	3. Myocardial infarctions
		1. 20% of all deaths in USA
		2. Coronary arteries blocked so that myocardial cells die
	4. Strokes
		1. Occurs when blood to brain is blocked
		2. Partial paralysis of body
	5. Aneurysm
		1. High blood pressure
		2. Causes ballooned arteries to rupture

1. Chapter 34 - Nutrition and The Digestive System
	1. Process of Chemical Digestion
		1. Catabolism ("Breaking down" - uses water) vs Anabolism ("Building up")
		2. Three major macromolecules
			1. Carbohydrates
				1. Starch (glucose chain)
					1. Polysaccharides are sources of immediate energy after breaking them down
					2. Can also be stored
					3. Monomer = glucose
						1. Absorbed in the SI into the blood 
					4. Amylase (salivary in mouth or pancreatic in duodenum of SI) breaks down polysaccharides into maltose (disaccharide)
					5. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose (monosaccharide)
				2. Cellulose (fiber)
					1. We cannot directly break down using chemical digestion
					2. Microbial digestion can break this down
			2. Proteins (functional polypeptides)
				1. Monomer = amino acids
					1. Held by peptide bonds
				2. Waste = ammonia -> urea -> urine
				3. Proteins do everything :)
					1. Transport, structure, hemoglobin, etc.
				4. Trypsin and pepsin breaks down polypeptides into smaller polypeptide chains
					1. Pepsinogen released by chief cells
						1. Activated in presence of HCL (secreted by parietal cells) to create pepsin
							1. HCL decreases pH, which changes protein conformation
							2. Duodenum is lower pH than stomach
					2. Trypsinogen released by pancreas
						1. Activated in presence of higher pH (stomach)
						2. Stomach is higher pH than duodenum 
				5. Peptidase breaks down the smaller polypeptide chains into amino acids
					1. Released by pancreas (?)
				6. 20 amino acids
					1. 8 essential amino acids that must come from diet
				7. Absorbed into the blood in the SI
			3. Lipids (triglycerides)
				1. Unsaturated fats (double bond -> kink)
					1. Liquid at room temp
					2. Plants
					3. Mono- = one double bond
					4. Poly- = multiple double bonds
				2. Saturated (no double bonds -> straight)
					1. Solid at room temp
					2. Animals
				4. Parts of triglycerides
					1. Glycerol + three fatty acids
				5. Parts of phospholipids
					1. Glycerol + two fatty acids
				6. Visceral fat = bad
				7. Cutaneous fat = internal, good
				8. Purpose = insulation and energy storage
				9. There are essential fatty acids (such as Omega-3, which can come from salmon, flaxseed, certain oils, etc.)
				10. Hydrophobic 
				11. Bile salts emulsify the fats
					1. Produced by liver and stored/concentrated in gallbladder
					2. Break down fat globules 
				12. Lipase breaks down triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids
				13. Absorbed into the lymphatic system
	2. Read Nutrition Labels
	3. Fat vs water soluble vitamins
	4. Know purposes of vitamins and minerals
2. Chapter 35 - The Nervous System
	1. Structure of Neuron
		1. Dendrites (receptors)
		2. Cell body
		3. Axon
		4. Axon terminals (transmitters)
	2. Resting Potential
		1. About -70mV
			1. Negative inside cell, positive outside cell
		2. Maintained by Na+K+ pump
			1. Three Na+ ions out for every two K+ ions out
			2. Requires ATP (energy)
		3. Voltage gated ion channels
			1. Prevent ions from diffusing (for the most part - K+ a little leaky) unless opened by a voltage stimulus 
	3. Action Potential Process
		1. Resting potential state (-70mV)
		2. Stimulus/Signal 
			1. Could be another neuron axon terminals, could be external sense
		3. Na+ channels open if threshold of -55mV is reached
			1. If threshold not reached, action potential does not occur and neuron not stimulated
		4. Cell depolarizes as Na+ floods in
		5. K+ channels open as cell reaches peak (about 50mV)
		6. Na+ channels close
		7. Cell repolarizes as K+ ions leave and Na+ no longer enters
		8. K+ channels close
		9. Cell is hyperpolarized (cannot be stimulated for 1 ms)
		10. Cell returns to resting potential
			1. Na+K+ pump
		11. Action potential of the neuron causes neurotransmitter to be released to continue the signal to other neurons (or stimulate a muscle to contract)
	4. Chemical Synapses
		1. Where axon terminal of a neuron meets another cell (another neuron or a muscle cell)
			1. Can be a neuro-muscular junction or a chemical synapse between two neurons
			2. Signal generally travels in one direction
		2. Synaptic vesicles hold neurotransmitters 
			1. Chemical messengers
		3. Voltage gated Ca channels 
			1. When stimulated by action potential, allows channels to open so that Ca floods in
			2. Influx of Ca allows neurotransmitters to be released
				1. Vesicles binds w/ membrane and release them in process called exocytosis
			3. NTs travel synaptic cleft and bind to ligand gated channels on the receiver cell
				1. Acetylcholine used for neuro-muscular junctions 
				2. Ligand gated channels open and allow Na+ to enter causing excitatory postsynaptic potential for contraction to occur

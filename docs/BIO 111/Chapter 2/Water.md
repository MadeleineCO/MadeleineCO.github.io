I. [[Chemical Bonds]]
	A. Electrical attraction of [[Water]] molecules can disrupt forces holding ions together
	B. Water is in bent shape because of two negative H
		- This makes it a polor molecule
	C. Cohesion = polarity of [[Water]] allows water molecules to be attracted to one another
		- Net positive charge of H attracted to net positive charge of O
	D. Contains hydrogen bonds
		- Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid [[Water]]
			a. Ice has more hydrogen bonds and is collectively stronger than water or gas, which fill shape of container
				i. Liquid water at 4 degrees is the most dense, which is why ice floats
				ii. Polarity of water
					~ Within a water molecule, the bonds between oxygen and hydrogen are highly polar (O is much more electronegative than H)
					~ Partial electrical charges develop
						~ Oxygen is partially negative δ–
						~ Hydrogen is partially positive δ+
				iii. Properties of water
					~ Water has a high specific heat (a large amount of energy is required to change the temp of water)
					~ Water has a high heat a vaporization (The evaporation of water from a surface causes cooling of that surface)
					~ Solid water is less dense than liquid water (Bodies of water freeze from the top down)
					~ Water is a good solvent (Water dissolves *polar* molecules and ions)
						~ Like dissolves like
					~ Water organizes nonpolar molecules
						~ Hydrophilic = "water loving"
						~ Hydrophobic = "water fearing"
						~ Water causes hydrophobic molecules to aggregate or assume specific shapes
					~ Water can form ions $$H^{2}O \rightarrow OH^{-} + H$$
							~Water --> Hydroxide ion + Hydrogen ion
							~ When table salt (NaCl) is mixed in water, spheres of hydration are formed around the ions
							~ Leads to the development of [[Acids and bases]]

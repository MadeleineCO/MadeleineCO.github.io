1. [[Energy]] for all life ultimately comes from photosynthesis
2. Equation
	$$6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy\rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}C_{6} + 6O_{2}$$
	- Anabolic reaction
		1. Lower in energy to higher in [[energy]]
	- Oxygen is generated as waste product while [[Carbohydrate|carbs]] are stored
3. Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs in the presence of oxygen
	- Cyanobacteria 
	- 7 groups of algae (algae are not plants)
	- All land plants use chloroplasts and phytoplankton use it in parts of the ocean
		1. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyl
4. Deep ocean creatures do not have access to sunlight
	- Chemoautotrophs generate energy from other sources than sunlight 
		1. Ex: hydrogen sulfide
5. Other organisms are heterotrophs
	- Herbivores eat plants and metabolize energy created and stored from photosynthesis
		1. Must eat a lot of plants because relatively low energy
	- Carnivores eat other [[organism|organisms]]
		1. Don't need to eat on the scale of herbivores bc their prey contains much higher energy than plants
6. Plant vascular tissue for transportation
	- Xylem brings [[water]] up from the roots
	- Phloem brings sugar down to the roots
7. How do you take CO2 and make a sugar?
	- Small carbon molecules are built up into a sugar
8. Chloroplast
	- Thylakoid membrane - internal membrane 
		1. Barrier just like in mitochondria
		2. Contains chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments
			- Pigments capture the [[energy]]
			- Pigments clustered into photosystems
	-  ---
	- Granum
		1. Stacks of thylakoids 
	- Inner membrane and outer membrane ([[Plasma Membranes]])
	- ---
9. Stages of photosynthesis
	- Light-dependent reactions
		1. Requires light
		2. Ocurr in the thylaxoid membrane
		3. Makes [[ATP]] and reduces NADP+ to NADPH
			- NADP+ is a electron carrier and nucleotide similar to NAD+
		4. Converts light [[energy]] into chemical energy
		5. Granum captures photons of light and makes ATP and NADPH
		6. The Calvin Cycle
			- Takes place in stroma
			- Uses energy derived from these compounds to make 3 carbon GA3P molecules and CO2
				1. The 3 C GA3P can be linked together to for different monosaccharides such as glucose, fructose, etc. 
			- See graphic!
				1. ---
	- Light-independent reactions (carbon fixation reactions)
		1. Does not require light
		2. Uses [[ATP]] and NADPH to synthesize organic molecules from CO2
10. Photoautotrophs
	- ---
	- Capture energy from sun
11. [[Light]]
12. Pigments
	- Molecules that absorb [[light]] energy in the visible range
	- Light is form of [[energy]]
		1. Photon is a particle of light
			- A discrete bundle of energy
			- Energy content of a photon is inversely proportional to wavelength of the light
				1. Violet photons have more energy than red photons
	- Photelectric effect
		1. The removal of ---
	- Absorption spectrum = ---
	- Two broad categories
		1. Chlorophylls
			- We see these as green
		2. Carotenoids
			- We see these as oranges or yellows or purples
			- Xanthophyl 
		3. Capture different photons of light
	- Either absorb or reflect [[energy]]
		1. We see the color that it reflects
		2. Rest of colors that we don't see are absorbed
		3. Chlorophyll has a C and H tail
			- Nonpolar like membranes
			- Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and b-carotene are hydrophobic pigments found in thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll a and b are identical except for part on end that are responsible for different colors of leaves. B-carotene is responsible for orange color in carrots. Each pigment has a unique absorbance spectrum
		4. In deciduous trees, chlorophyll breaks down in leaves first and leaves turn to red or orange. Then carotenoids like xanthophyll degrade and leaf turns brown and dies
	- Structure of chlorophyll
		1. Porphyrin ring
			- Complex ring structure w/ alternating double and single bonds
			- Magnesium ion at the center of the ring
			- Hydrocarbon and hydrophobic
			- Photons excite electrons in the ring
				1. Electrons are shuttled away from the ring
			- ---
	- Plants that grow in shade have adapted to low levels of [[light]] by changing the relative concentrations of their chlorophyll pigments
13. Chloroplasts have two connected photosystems
	- ---
	- Photosystem II works first
	- Photosystem I works second
	- [[Light]] hits porphyrin ring, excites electrons, and electrons are passed along the rings to the reaction center. 
		1. Energized electrons used in reaction center
		2. Oxidized [[water]] is just oxygen, which is the waste product
			- Water is spit in the reaction center

1. Animal Breeding is a branch of genetics, while reproduction is an aspect of physiology
3. When making selection and mating decisions, made in context of available repro technologies
4. Artificial Insemination
	1. Semen collected from males
	2. Used fresh, cooled, or frozen to breed females
	3. Not always easy or practical
		1. Females must be in heat and moved to breeding area
		2. Must be properly inseminated at the correct time
			1. Females ovulate at certain times
	4. Benefits of AI
		1. Can use genes of a superior sire even after sire is dead
		2. Can control what animal breeds w/ what animal
		3. Portable (can use semen from bulls across the world)
	5. Estrus Synchronization
		2. Hormones used to induce females to come into heat at the same time
		3. Benefit = reduces number of days to inseminate
		4. PGF2a (Regression of CL and decrease in progesterone synthesis)
			1. Prostaglandin
			2. CL = corpus luteum 
			3. Decrease in hormone of pregnancy
		5. Progestogen (negative feedback on hypothalamus by blocking LH and FSH)
			1. Can be put in feed of animal 
				1. But animals may eat different amounts 
			2. Can also use CIDR = controlled internal drug release
			3. LH = ---
			4. FSH = Follicle Stimulating Hormone
		6. GnRH (ovulation/luteinization of growing follicle)
			1. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone 
5. Embryo Transfer
	1. Collection of embryos from donor females then transplant to recipient females
	2. Donor is *superovulated*
		1. Hormone injected causes her to develop and release more ova than normal
		2. Inseminated
	3. After around six days, the embryos transferred to recips (surrogates) or frozen
	4. Benefit = Allows females to have many more offspring than normal 
	5. Problem =  Identifying candidates can be difficult (limited data)
		1. Also certain problems for genetic evaluation (issues w/ maternal traits as recips usually not high quality animals)
			1. Calves may be harmed by an inferior maternal env (ex WW is a trait w/ maternal effects)
			2. Must try to correct for this
		2. More costly and difficult than AI
		3. Must synchronize donor and recips if using fresh embryos 
	6. ET to the female is like AI to the male

6. *In Vitro* Fertilization
	1. *In Vivo* = in a live animals
	2. *In Vitro* = in a test tube
	3. *In Sacco* = in a plastic bag
	4. Fertilization in a test tube
	5. Eggs (oocytes) collected from donor female through aspiration of the repro tract
	6. Incubated/matured & fertilized in lab
	7. Frozen or transferred to recip
	8. Graphic of process![[Pasted image 20230410102232.png]]
		1. Use semen analysis to make sure you use the best
	9. Another graphic![[Pasted image 20230410102603.png]]
	10. Egg Harvest
		1. Ultrasound-Guided Aspiration
		2. Laparoscopy
			1. The use of minimally invasive surgery to put a thin, lighted tube through an incision in the belly to look at the abdominal or female pelvic organs
		3. Embryos are usually transferred at the 8-cell or blastocyst stage
			1. Around six days in cattle
	11. Advantages
		1. Increased number of possible pregnancies
		2. Can collect eggs repeatedly from same donor at short intervals 
		3. Doesn't have to be at a certain stage of estrous cycle
		4. No need to superovulate the donor females 
		5. Decreases generation interval 
		6. Eggs can be collected from young, pre-pubertal females
			1. Then matured, fertilized, and transferred 
		7. Can be transferred to multiple animals so you generate more offspring
			1. More offspring = more genetic data 
	12. Disadvantages 
		1. Expensive
		2. Relatively low success rate
		3. May cause abnormalities in offspring 
			1. Genes that aren't supposed to be turned on in certain areas are turned on

7. Sex Control
	1. Possible to *determine sex of embryo* by physically removing a few cells and *examining chromosomes* 
		1. Can tell even when it is just a few days old
	2. Y-specific DNA probe
		1. A probe that looks for the Y chromosome (Y = male, no Y = female)
	3. Y-specific DNA primer and PCR
		1. Primer = sequence of nucleotides that is usually 20-22 NT long 
			1. In process of DNA replication, the primer binds to the stand that DNA polymerase will first begin to copy 
			2. PCR = Allows you to make several copies of a DNA strand 
				1. Gel electrophoresis shows if there is a Y present 
	4. Sperm Sorting 
		1. Sorts sperm cells into YX and XX
			1. At first, rate too slow to make sexed sperm commercially viable
			2. Over time, gained knowledge about the process
				1. Now many companies that sex semen 
		2. Sexed semen is more expensive and contains fewer sperm cells
		3. Flow cytometry = the method used to sort sperm
			1. Measures the cells as they flow through a detector based on the DNA content of the sperm cells 
				1. X chromosome contains about 4% more DNA than the Y chromosome
			2. Sex Steps
				1. Semen is labeled w/ fluorescent dye (Hoechst 33342), which binds to the DNA
				2. X chromosome absorbs more dye than the Y (bc its bigger)
				3. When exposed to UV light, the X fluoresces is glows brighter than the Y
				4. Spermatozoa are encased in a single droplet of fluid as they pass the flow cytometer in a single file line
				5. Spermatozoa are assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (ex X = pos and Y = neg)
				6. Stream of X and Y droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separated tubes for subsequent analysis 
			3. Sorting by charge
				1. Sample input into funnel -> Laser excitation -> High Voltage deflection plates sort based on electric charge

		4. New technology researched the 1980s
			1. Commercially available in 2004
			2. Takes advantage of female sperm having 4% more DNA
			3. Slow process since it takes 3-4 times longer to process the semen (even at 60 mph rate)

	5. Results
		1. Ability to produce desired sex of calf w/ 90% accuracy
		2. AI companies can package less sperm cells since the dead and abnormal cells are sorted off
		3. Semen now commercially available 
	6. Application
		1. First used in dairy
			1. Reduced num of bull calves (bulls worth $50 vs heifers valued at $350
		2. Sex choice depends on herd genetics and marketing programs
		3. Commercial herds want male calves from cows
		4. Seedstock herds want male calves for resale 
	7. Why bother? 
		1. One sex may be more valuable than the other 
			1. Males for meat
			2. Females for milk
		2. Better economics
			1. If sire strong for maternal traits, use him to produce female offspring 
		3. Crossbreeding systems
8. Cloning 
	1. Technology for the production of genetically identical individuals 
	2. Embryo Splitting
		1. Small scale cloning?
			1. More of a way of improving efficiency of embryo transfer than cloning
		2. Somatic cell nuclear transfer 
		3. Process of cutting embryo in half to produce twin embryos 
		4. Transferred to recips 
	3. Cloning by Nuclear Transplantation
		1. Eggs matured *in vitro*
		2. Nuclei surgically removed (creates enucleated egg)
		3. Individual cells from multi-cell embryo inserted into each ova (egg)
			1. Ova supports the growth
		4. Produces a number of identical embryos 
	4. Embryos can be transferred or frozen
		1. Or can serve as cell donors for repeated cycles of cloning by nuclear transplantation
	5. Measure cloned animals for performance
		1. Progeny test
		2. Statistical analysis
		3. Big advantage of cloning = shortens Gi
			1. More rapid improvement over time
	6. However, need to cross clonal lines due to inbreeding depression
	7. Benefits of Cloning
		1. Big jump in genetic merit
			1. One generation = genetically elite animals 
		2. Increases uniformity of performance
			1. Any observed variation is due to the environment
			2. The higher the h^2 the trait, the more unform the pop for that trait
		3. Increases accuracy of selection
			1. By virtue of large amounts of performance data for each clonal line
			2. Increased selection intensity by providing virtually unlimited access to the very best clonal lines 
	8. Problems w/ Cloning
		1. Loss of genetic variation if small num of clonal lines
			1. Variation is needed for future improvement 
			2. Excessive inbreeding
		2. A single clonal line could compromise a significant proportion of the pop
			1. Risk that line could be susceptible to pathogen or env stress leading to widespread loss of production
		3. Time-consuming to genetically evaluate each line before making commercially available
		4. Some abnormal newborns
		5. Many die
		6. Expensive
			1. May waste creating many clonal lines if you select only a few and discard the rest
	9. The Dolly Revolution
		1. Adult sheep cloned in 1996
			1. Dolly
		2. Roslin Institute
		3. 277 attempts
		4. Used mammary tissue
		5. Dolly died in 2006 (6 yr old)
	10. Cloning Adult Animals
		1. Insert mature, differentiated cells into the ovum
			1. All genes necessary for growth must be there 
		2. Somatic cell's genes are "turned on" to produce different types of tissues 
		3. Age rapidly
			1. Telomeres on chromosomes unravel 
				1. Telomeres = specialized terminal structures on chromosomes that ensure the maintenance and accuracy of replication
				2. Like protective caps
		4. Could we use in on animals that have proven genetic worth? 
			1. Yes, but performance differences may arise from env variation
		5. Cloning of a Ewe (The Roslin Method)
			1. Ewe provides mammary cell to be cloned
				1. Mammary cell contains copies of all genes needed to produce a sheep, but only genes for mammary cells are active
			2. Cells grow and divide, generating precise copies 
				1. Then cells are deprived of nutrients (induce dormancy)
				2. At this stage, all genes can be activated
			3. Another (or even the same) ewe provides the egg
				1. Perserved in a lab dish
			4. Nucleus is dislodged from the egg (enucleated)
			5. Mammary cell and nucleus from egg blend w/ a spark of electricity
				1. Molecules in the egg then program genes in the mammary cell to engender the embryo
			6. Clusters of embryonic cells are grown
			7. Embryos then implanted in surrogate mother 
				1. Resulting lamb is a clone of donor ewe

	11. Different species that have been cloned
		1. Sheep, Cattle, Mice, Goats, Pigs, Rats, Rabbits, Cats, Mouflon, Gaur, Mule, Deer, Banteng, Dog, Horse, Ferret, Wolf, Camel, Ibex
	12. Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer
		1. Technique for creating ovum w/ donor nucleus
		2. Used in. . .
			1. Embryonic stem cell research
			2. "Therapeutic" cloning
				1. Generate stem cells via cloning
				2. Cells not used to create another individual
			3. Reproductive cloning 
				1. First step
				2. Leads to creation of another live individual
		3. SCNT Limitations
			1. Stresses placed on both egg cell and introduced nucleus are enormous
				1. High loss in resulting cells
			2. Ex: Dolly
				1. 277 ova used for SCNT
				2. 29 viable embryos
				3. 3 lambs at birth
				4. Only 1 survived
				5. Very low success rate
					1. Now about 40% success rate (from video)
			3. Procedure cannot be automated
				1. Manually under microscope
			4. Biochemistry involved in reprogramming differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating recipient ovum is not well understood 
			5. Not all of donor's genetic info is transferred
				1. Mitochondrial DNA left behind
				2. Hybrid cells retain those structures that originally belonged to ovum
			6. Clones such as Dolly born from SCNT
				1. Not perfect copies of the donor of nucleus 
			7. Controversy
				1. Proposals to use nuclear transfer techniques in human stem cell research
					1. Raises set of concerns beyond moral status of created embryo
				2. Blastula creation in human stem cell research
					1. Leads to repro cloning of humans
				3. Repro cloning of humans and human stem cell research
					1. Use same first step (creation of nuclear transferred embryo)
				4. Those that are concerned advocate for strong regulation of SCNT
				5. Another concern
					1. Appropriate sourcing of ovum that are needed
					2. Requires human ova obtained from women
					3. Most common source of ova
						1. Produced in excess of clinical need during IVF treatment

9. Same Sex Mating
	1. Mating of individuals of same sex
	2. Using procedures for nuclear transplantation & embryo transfer
	3. Technique called *nuclear fusion*
		1. Artificial fertilization that combines the nuclei of two gametes
	4. Theoretically possible to have individuals whose parents are both male or female
		1. May never work
			1. May need chromosomes from both male and female origins to support fetal development
	5. Why attempt? 
		1. Increased selection accuracy and intensity
		2. Mate the best sires to the best sires
		3. Male x male
			2. 2 males (XY)
			3. 1 female (XX)
			4. 1 no go (YY)
		4. Female x female
			1. All females (XX)
	6. Selfing = Mating of individual to themselves

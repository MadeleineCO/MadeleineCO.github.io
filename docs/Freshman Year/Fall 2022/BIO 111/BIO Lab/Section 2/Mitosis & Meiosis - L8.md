1. Terms
	- DNA = Deoxyribose nucleic acid
	- Nucleotide = monomer of nucleic acid
	- Chromatin = complex of DNA inside the nucleus; uncondensed 
		1. DNA spends most of its time in this form
	- Chromosome = condensed and organized chromatin
	- Chromatid = arm of the chromosome
	- Gene = portion of DNA that codes for a trait (which is expressed as a protein)
		1. Instructions to build a particular protein
		2. Genes lead to traits
	- Allele = alternative forms of genes
		1. Genes exist in various forms with different varieties
		2. Ex: Brown gene or blue eye gene
	- Haploid = When a cell has one copy of each chromosome
		1. Our human haploid number is 23
		2. Gamete cells 
	- Diploid = When a cell has two copies of each chromosome
		1. Humans have 23 pairs or 46 total chromosomes in the majority of our cells
	- Homozygous = When alleles for a trait are identical
		1. You have one set from mother and one set from father so two copies of every chromosome
		2. If set from mother and father are the same, you are homozygous
	- Heterozygous = When alleles for a trait are not identical
		1. Set from mother and set from father are different
2. Mitosis (asexual reproduction)
	- Main function is maintenance and growth
		1. We all started life as a single zygote 
		2. That zygote divided through mitosis and grew
		3. Replaces dead cells 
	- Cloning (no genetic diversity)
	- Somatic cells
		1. The majority of our cells are somatic cells
		2. Where mitosis occurs 
	- 1 cell > 2 cells
		1. A single cell divides to become two cells
		2. Chromosomal num does not change
		3. Diploid (2n) to diploid (2n)
	- Cell cycle
		1. Interphase --> prophase --> metaphase --> anaphase --> telophase
		2. Interphase
			- Chromatid dispersed throughout nucleus 
			- Majority of a cell's life is spent in interphase
		3. Prophase
			- DNA begins to condense and organizes into chromosomes
			- Centrioles form
			- Nuclear envelope dissolves 
		4. Metaphase
			- Chromosomes line up along metaphase plate (like equator)
		5. Anaphase
			- Chromosomes pulled apart
			- Move toward opposite poles
		6. Telophase
			- Nuclear envelope reforms
		7. Cytokinesis
			- Division into two separate cells
	- Unchecked mitotic growth leads to cancer
	- Mitosis in an onion root tip
		1. Roots must elongate and grow through mitosis 
	- Mitosis in white fish blastula
3. Meiosis (sexual reproduction)
	- Formation of gametes (sperm and eggs)
	- Occurs in germ cells 
	- 1 cell > 4 cells
	- 2 divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II)
		1. Meiosis I (Interphase I --> prophase I --> metaphase I --> anaphase I --> telophase I)
			- Reduction division (where chromosome number is divided)
			- Genetic diversity introduced during crossing over in prophase I and independent assortment during metaphase I
			- No interphase after meiosis (goal is to produce haploid gametes so no chromosomal duplication)
		2. Meiosis II (Interphase II --> prophase II --> metaphase II --> anaphase I --> telophase II)
			- Similar to mitosis
	- Chromosome number halved 
		1. Diploid (2n) to haploid (1n)
	- Produces genetic diversity

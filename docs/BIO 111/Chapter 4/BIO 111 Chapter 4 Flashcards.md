^1662220076755

Prokaryotic Cell::No membrane bound nucleus; DNA not defined by a membrane (collectively called nucleoid DNA instead of nucleus DNA); No well defined organelles
^1662220076763

Shapes of prokaryotic cells::Spherical (Cocci), rod (Bacillus), spiral (Spirilla)
^1662220076771

Two types of prokaryotes::Archaea (in unusual environments; heat tolerant proteins); Bacteria (ex: e-coli)
^1662220076779

Common characteristics of prokaryotic cells::Ribosomes, plasma membrane (boundary made up of phospholipids), cell wall (made up of carbs); locomotion (ex: flagella), cytoplasm (like water inside a water balloon; limits size)
^1662220076786

Surface (plasma membrane) area to volume (cytoplasm) relationship::Volume increases on a logarithmic scale (10 fold increase in volume to surface area); Why cells must be small
^1662220076792

Eukaryotic cells::Possess a membrane-bound nucleus; More complex than prokaryotic cells; Compartmentalizes many cellular functions within organelles and the endomembrane system
^1662220076797

In eukaryotic cells, DNA never leaves the nucleus, but --- does::RNA
^1662220076803

Eukaryotic cells possess a --- for support and to maintain cellular structure::cytoskeleton (gives organism its form)
^1662220076808

--- is the simplest eukaryotic organism::budding yeast (one of smallest genomes)
^1662601519861

Eukaryotic cells can be --- or ---::single celled or multicellular
^1662601519870

Plants have a --- and ---::cell wall; chloroplasts for photosynthesis
^1662601519875

Plasma membrane::Levels of fluidity differ; contains three of four macromolecules (proteins, lipids, and carbs)
^1662601519881

Nucleus::Endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus (where rRNA is made), chromatin (DNA that interacts w/ proteins), nucleoplasm, nuclear pore, nuclear envelope
^1662601519887

--- can go out of nucleus but --- cannot::RNA; DNA
^1662601519893

Ribosomes::Made up of large subunit and small subunit; Site of protein synthesis (assembles amino acids into proteins); Composed of ribosomal RNA and proteins; Found within the cytosol of the cytoplasm
^1662601519899

Mitochondria::Powerhouse of the cell; Where energy is made or converted from one form to another; Like a car engine; Present in all types of eukaryotes
^1662601519904

The mitochondria has two ---::membranes; outer and inner as well as fairly large organelles (about the size of bacteria)
^1662601519910

Prokaryotic cells do not have --- and generate energy in the ---::mitochondria; plasma membrane
^1662601519916

Mitochondria contain --- for transferring the energy within macromolecules to atp::oxidative metabolism enzymes
^1662601519922

Peroxisomes::break down fatty acids and amino acids; detoxifies poisons (ex alcohol; eating antioxidants helps these organelles); safely breaks down H2O into oxygen and water
^1662601519927

--- and --- in plants are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars::glyoximes; specialized peroxisomes
^1662601519933

Vesicles::smaller than vacuoles; can move and act like a package (easily delivered)
^1662601519939

Vacuoles::larger than vesicles; generally stationary; like a storage reservoir
^1662601519945

Animals cells have --- and ---, whereas plant cells do not::centrosomes and lysosomes
^1662601519950

Lysosome::like digestive stomach; can take, fuse with, and break down digested material; contains digestive enzymes and destroys engulfed cells
^1662601519956

Cells engulf other cells by ---::phagocytosis
^1662601519961

The insides of lysosomes are very ---::acidic; has proteins that pump H+ ions to lower pH
^1662601519968

Centrosome::Associated w/ microtubules; like railways throughout the cell; Microtubules make railways and vesicles are shipped on railways
^1662601519973

Plant cells have ---, whereas animal cells do not::cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and large central vacuole
^1662601519979

Cell wall::Composed of cellulose held by glycosidic bonds, so cellulose is not digestible
^1662601519985

Chloroplasts::Inner membranes and outer membranes; converts sunlight into sugars in plants
^1662601519991

Ribosomes are on the --- on nucleus::endoplasmic reticulum; can be transported in part of ER w/ vesicles through golgi apparatus then can fuse w/ plasma membrane
^1662601519997

How do you get membrane-bound protein out to plasma membrane?::Series of membranes throughout cytoplasm; can be rough (w/ ribosomes) or smooth (w/out ribosomes)
^1662601520003

Secretions::Can secrete proteins out of cells; can secrete carbs and fats; Lactation is from of secretion
^1662601520009

Membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the ---::rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
^1662601520015

Golgi apparatus::Has vesicles and folded membranes w/in cytoplasm; Helps w/ secretion and protein transport; Processes and packages proteins and lipids, especially proteins destined to be exported from cell
^1662601520021

Cytoskeleton::Actin filaments (smallest cytoskeletal component called the cortex that gives cell its shape), microtubules (largest cytoskeletal component that act as railways), and intermediate filaments (medium sized and cluster around nucleus but can be found throughout cell)
^1662601520026

Extracellular matrix (ECM)::Outside cell, proteins are transferred from ribosome through exocytosis to outside of cell
^1662601520032

Collagen::Fibrous protein that composes glycoproteins
^1662601520039

Integrin::Proteins present in plasma membrane; May be connected to cytoplasm; Anchors proteins on outside of cell
^1662601520045

Intercellular junctions::Plasmodesmata (channels b/t cell walls of plant cells), Cadherin (bind like-cells), Tight junctions (watertight seal b/t tissues), Gap junctions (channels for adjacent cells in animals), Desmosomes (maintains cells in sheet-like formation)

1. What is aerobic activity?
	- Ex: running, cycling, rowing, swimming, skating, boxing, jumping, walking
	- Aerobic activities involve. . .
		1. Large muscle groups
			- Multiple joints involved
		2. Dynamic movements
		3. Prolonged periods of time
			- Ten minutes or longer
	- Aerobics activities challenge your ability to make aerobic energy, which is reflected by noticeable increases in heart rate and breathing rate
1. How do you structure aerobic activity?
	- Warm-up
		1. Low-to-moderate intensity activity
		2. Gradual increase from rest to exercise
		3. Prepares your heart and muscles for the demands of the activity you'll be doing
		4. Should include light activity that is similar to the exercise you are planning to do, along w/ specific dynamic stretching
			- NOT static stretching
		5. Can also include targeted activities to reduce specific injury risks
	- Endurance conditioning (FITT principle)
		1. FITT principle = Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type
			- Each of these components interact w/ each other in a structured exercise plan
			- Frequency involves how often you exercise (days/weeks or sessions/week)
				1. Regular activity is best
				2. ACSM recommends that you do three days per week if it is vigorous intensity, 5 days per week if moderate intensity
			- Intensity involves how hard you exercise
				1. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and session-RPE
				2. Talk-sing test = point where you cannot sing is moderate and point where you cannot comfortably talk without odd breaths is vigorous 
				3. METs = metabolic equivalent tasks 
				4. Heart rate 
				5. ACSM recommends 3 days of vigorous or 5 days of moderate
			- Time
				1. Can be cumulative throughout day as long as it's completed in 10 min blocks
				2. General rule for health benefits: 1 min of vigorous-intensity activity is equivalent to 2 min of moderate-intensity activity
				3. Trying to add up to 150 min of moderate or 75 min/week of vigorous
			- Type
				1. What activity you choose to do
					- Principle of specify
						1. You adapt to what specific activity you most often do
							- Can be great runner but bad swimmer
							- Can be great cyclist but bad runner
							- Same health benefits but doesn't necessarily transfer 
					- Principle of variability
						1. If you do exact same thing, you may plateau
						2. Mix it up in some way in order to improve
					- Exercise adherence
						1. Pick a type of activity that you will actually do and enjoy doing at some level 
	- Cool down
		1. Low to moderate intensity activity
		2. Gradually transition from the demands of exercise back to rest
		3. If you're going to do static stretching, this is the best time
			- No effect on soreness
			- Can make you more flexible

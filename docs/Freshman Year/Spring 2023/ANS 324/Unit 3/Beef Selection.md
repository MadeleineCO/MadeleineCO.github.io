1. We have made more progress in [[Dairy Selection]] than we have in beef
	1. Dairy is like jet while beef is bicycle 
	2. Modifying animal to fit the env in beef
		1. In dairy, we modify env to fit animal
2. Beef Infrastructure
	1. Purebred
		1. Provide genetics 
			2. The baseline
		2. Referred to as seedstock producers
		3. Try to maintain purity
			1. Angus is Angus 
			2. Brahman is Brahman
			3. No crossbreeding
			4. No gene flow
	2. Cow/calf
		1. Goal = provide one weaned calf per year 
		2. Interested in reproduction traits 
			1. Fertility, Calving ease, etc.
	3. Stocker
		1. Buy the calves and put them in a pasture to mature
		2. Goal = fast growth
		3. Interested in growth traits
			1. Intramuscular fat, Feed efficiency, Meet Conditioning, etc.
		4. Matured until point where they are sold to feedlot
	5. Feedlot
		1. Finishing phase
		2. Goal = producing good carcass meat
		3. ---
	6. Packer
		1. Slaughter and packaging 
	7. Consumer
	8. Different goals at every phase
		1. Pushing animals in different directions whereas dairy only focused on one goal (milk production)
3. Major Differences From [[Dairy Selection|Dairy]]
	1. Producer goals and objectives differ
		1. Dairy has one goal (milk production)
		2. Goals include producing one calf per year, good carcass meat, growth traits, etc.
	2. Different env and level of available natural resources
		1. Best animals are those that adapt to your specific env the best
		2. We have temperate animals, tropical animals, etc.
	3. More traits of economic importance
		1. We select for more traits in beef than we do in dairy
		2. Have many subtraits has well
		3. More traits = slower rate of selection progress 
		4. Lack of vertical integration
			1. Vertical integration = one company controls all the different levels of production
				1. Ex: poultry meat industry
				2. Minimizes variation and removes middlemen
					1. Greater efficiency
			2. Everyone is running their own operation
			3. Genetic correlation of traits
				1. If positive correlation, than faster selection progress
				2. If negative correlation, much slower progress
				3. Genetic correlation table![[Pasted image 20230324103127.png]]
					1. Negative genetic correlation in repro = less genetic ability
					2. Weaning at BW and Weaning wgt at WW is just one
					3. Carcass grade switches from negative at BW to positive at WW
				4. Fertility/Repro Traits Selected For in Beef
					1. Calving Ease
					2. First service conception
					3. Heifer pregnancy
					4. Rebreeding rate
					5. Stayabilitiy
					6. Days open
					7. Daughter pregnancy rate
					8. We usually look at these to rank bulls
						1. Know these traits
					9. Scrotum Circumference 
				5. Growth Traits Selected For in Beef 
					1. Birth Wgt
					2. Weaning Wgt
					3. Yearling Wgt
					4. Average Daily Gain (ADG)
					5. Feed Efficiency (FE)
						1. Ratio of amount of gain per unit of feed
					6. Hgt at Withers 
				6. Carcass Traits 
					1. Intramuscular fat
						1. Measure of marbling
					2. Fat thickness 
						1. Measure of marbling
					3. Ribeye area 
		5. No centralized record-keeping system
			1. Each major breed association has own published sire summary
			2. Unlike DHIA, which keeps extensive dairy records
			3. ---
			4. Problems w/ Performance Records
				1. Sire summaries don't mean semen or bull is available (AI < 13%)
					1. AI is not used much in beef
				2. BV's calculated within breed only 
					1. Cannot use sire summaries to compare breeds
				3. G x E interactions can dramatically alter performance
		6. Slower adaption to technology
			1. Dairy industry embraced genomic selection
				1. Improves accuracy
				2. Not used much in beef
					1. Mainly bc of small herds and part-time ranchers
			2. Only 13% of operations use some AI
		7. High level of crossbreeding in beef
			1. Beef cows
				1. 21% purebred
				2. 45% two-breed cross
				3. 35% three-or-more breeds
				4. Many use cross-bred Angus 
			2. Beef calves
				1. 16% purebred
				2. 37% 2-breed cross
				3. 47% 3-or-more breeds
			3. Across breed EPD adjustments
				1. Most useful to commercial producers *purchasing bulls* for use in *crossbreeding* programs
				2. Must be careful and buy bulls w/ the numbers you want
				3. Calculates a table that is produced every year by government agency in Nebraska
				4. Use the table to make adjustments for when you want to buy bulls
				5. Emphasizes.  .  .
					1. *Uniformity* for *rotational* crossbreeding
						1. Uniform calves desirable
					2. *Divergence* for *terminal* crossbreeding
					3. *Divergence* of* birth wgt* EPDs for bulls to breed to *first calf heifers*
						1. First calf heifers should produce small calves for ease
				6. Accuracy of across-breed EPD depends on accuracy of within-breed EPD for the bull
					1. Each breed produces their own EPD
					2. As you get more information, Cross-breed EPD Adjustments change
				7. See example tables on slideshow
					1. Angus is 0.0 for all stats on the table
						1. This is bc all the comparisons for other breeds are made against Angus
						2. Angus is the baseline
						3. Ex: You could expect an addition of 2.9 lbs for Hereford calf compared to Angus
					2. Lets you know what to expect
						1. All predictions
4. Selecting Against Deleterious Recessive Alleles
	1. Deleterious alleles should be heavily selected against
	2. If possible, you can use genetic testing (screening against carriers)
		1. Ex: Tibial Hemimelia in Shorthorn cattle
			1. Causes severe, lethal deformities in calves (rear legs w/ fused joints, large abdominal hernias, skull deformity)
				1. Autosomal recessive
			2. American Shorthorn Association requires all AI sires, donor dams, and cloned animals to be tested for TH
				1. A list of "free" and "carrier" animals is maintained by ASA
				2. All animals can be registered but only "free" animals can be sold at ASA sanctioned sales
	3. Curly Calf Syndrome
		1. Found in Angus breed
			1. Linked to bull called GAR Precision 1680
		2. Causes curved spine, extended and contracted limbs, and tend to have a "thin" appearance
			1. Autosomal recessive
	4. Developmental Duplication (Polymelia)
		1. Latest genetic disorder found in Angus
			1. Recognized in Australia
		2. Causes calves to be born w/ extra limbs
			1. This can also be caused by embryo env
		3. Work of Jonathan Beever (U of III.) geneticist found commonality in genes associated w/ affected calves compared to normal calves
		4. Genetic testing indicates that 3% of US sires are carriers and a breed wide frequency of 6%
		5. The concern w/ carriers
			1. Dd x Dd = 25% chance of dd
				1. Rare occurrence of developmental duplication 
			2. High death rate among dd individuals
			3. Complication = incomplete penetrance
				1. Sometimes animals are dd but do not exhibit duplication
				2. It is important to perform genetic tests to determine if they simply do not show the phenotype
5. Genetic Testing
	1. We have started using genetic testing for traits other than deleterious alleles
	2. Ex: homozygous vs heterozygous polled
	3. Ex: homozygous vs heterozygous black
		1. Some Angus are red (some are heterozygous)
		2. You can test for coat color
	4. Tenderness markers
		1. Especially important to predict meat quality
		2. Calpain gene is and indicator of more tender meat
		3. Called *MAS* (Marker Assisted Selection)
6. Good Side of Beef Selection (Compared to Dairy)
	1. Many economic traits have high h^2 and are not sex-limited
		1. High h^2 = faster selection
			1. Offspring expected to look more like parents
		2. Can measure many of the traits in both sexes
			1. BW, WW, Carcass traits, etc.
	2. Many traits are easily measured
		1. Including carcass traits
			1. We can use ultrasounds to measure carcass traits such as intramuscular fat on live animals
		2. Can use indicator traits for those that you cannot directly measure
		3. Consolidation of packing industry
			1. Boxed beef
			2. Desired animal carcasses have been standardized
			3. Future changes in industry should be more consistent
7. Keys to Success From a Genetic Standpoint
	1. Recognition of value of performance records and EPVs
		1. Dairy does not make as much progress as beef bc dairy has less extensive records 
			1. Without records, nothing to work with
			2. Must learn what they mean and how they are determined
	2. Recognition and identification of breeds that excel in certain characteristics
		1. Must know which breeds work well in which environments 
		2. Not one breed fits all 
	3. Selection
		1. Avoid fads and short term outlooks
		2. Determine herd objectives
		3. Select breeds compatible to your. . .
			1. Objectives
			2. Environment
		4. Objective measures for selection
			1. Records
	4. Adjusted weaning weights
		1. Purpose is to account for variations in wgt between animals that should be weaned at one time
		2. Animals are not all calving at the same time but you want animals to be similar weights at weaning time
			1. Animals from different breeds, mothers, environments, etc. will all have varying weaning weights at weaning time
		3. Must use an adjustment factor
			1. Accounts for all sources of variation, including. . . 
				1. Genetic (cow/calf)
				2. Age of calf
				3. Breed
				4. Age of dam
					1. Older cows produce heavier calves than less experienced cows
				5. Sex of calf
					1. Males generally grow faster
					2. Sexual dimorphism 
			2. ADJ 205 days = (actual wgt - birth wgt) x 205 + birth wgt  /  age in days
				1. There are also equations to account for sex and calf and maternal env and age of dam
	5. Most Probable Producing Ability (MPPA)
		1. Accounts for cows w/ different number of records 
		2. Repeatability = Estimates probability of repeated documented performance in the future
			1. Refers to expression of same trait at different times in the life of the same individual
			2. Repeatability = h^2 + maternal env
				1. r = repeatability
			3. Ex: WW  -  h^2 = 0.3 and r = 0.4
				1. Repeatability is always higher than h^2 bc it accounts for maternal influence of cow that can be documented by previous calf performance
				2. ---
				3. See tables on slideshow
		3. MPPA = HA + nr/(1 + (n - 1)r) x (CA - HA)
			1. Formula$$MPPA = HA + \frac{nr}{1 + (n -1)}(CA - HA)$$
			2. n = num of records for each individual
			3. r = repeatability estimate for one record
			4. HA = herd avg
			5. CA = cow avg
			6. Will be on test :)

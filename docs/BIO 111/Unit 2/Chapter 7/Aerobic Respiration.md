1. [[Cellular Respiration]]
2. Final electron receptor is oxygen (O2)
	1. [[Anaerobic respiration]]
		- Final electron acceptor is an inorganic molecule (not O2)
	2. [[Fermentation]]
		- Final electron acceptor is an organic molecule
3. Makes [[ATP]]
	1. Cells use ATP to drive endergonic reactions ([[Energy]])
		- Delta G = -7.3 kcal/mol
		- Cannot store ATP (unstable so you must make it and use it)
	2. 2 Mechanisms for synthesis
		- Substrate level phosphorylation
			- The transfer of a phosphate group directly to ADP
				1. Phosphorylation = adding or removing phosphate groups
			- During glycolysis
		- Oxidative phosphorylation
			- ATP synthase (protein) uses energy from a proton gradient
				1. Allows proteins to move from high concentration to low concentration
	3. [[ATP]] Structure
		- Three unstable phosphates (high energy and neg charge)
			- Break very easily
		- If you break one phosphate (hydrolysis reaction), you get ADP
			- In phosphorylation reactions, the gamma phosphate of ATP is attached to a [[protein]]
			- When tertiary structure is phosphorylated, the structure is changed and therefore the function changes
4. Oxidation of glucose
	1. Keep track of C nums!
		- Glucose begins w/ 6 carbons
			- Oxidation takes energy in 6 carbons and ultimately releases energy (exergonic)
	2. Four stages
		- Glycolysis
			- "Glyco" = sugar
			- "lysis" = breaking down
			- Occurs in the cytoplasm of [[cell]]
			- Converts 1 glucose (6 carbons) to 2 pyruvates (3 carbons each)
			- 10-step biochemical pathway
				1. Takes glucose and creates ADP from ATP and puts phosphate on glucose
				2. Takes another glucose and attaches another phosphate group (ATP --> ADP in process)
					1. Ends up with two 3-carbon molecules
				3. Makes NADH from NAD+
				4. Makes two ATP from ADP by taking phosphate from two 3-carbon molecules
				5. Ends up with two 3-carbon molecules (pyruvate) without phosphate attached and net goin of 2 ATP
					1. Net production of 2 ATP molecules by substrate level phosphorylation
			- 2 NADH by reduction of NAD+
				1. For glycolysis to continue, NADH must be recycled to NAD 
					1. Can occur via aerobic respiration
						1. Provides significant amount of ATP
						2. Oxygen is available as the final electron acceptor
					2. Can occur via [[fermentation]]
						1. Occurs when oxygen not available
						2. Organic molecule is the final electron acceptor
		- [[Catabolism of Proteins]]
		- Fate of pyruvate
			- Depends on oxygen availability
				1. When oxygen is present, pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA which enters the Krebs cycle
					1. Aerobic respiration
				2. Without oxygen, pyruvate is reduced in order to oxidize NADH back to NAD+
					1. Fermentation
		- Pyruvate oxidation (lowers [[Energy]])
			- In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is oxidized
			- Occurs in mitochondria in eukaryotes (occurs in plasma membrane in prokaryotes)
				1. Mitochondria has lots of [[Plasma Membranes]]
					1. Membranes act as a partition of water and semipermeable barrier
					2. Inner membrane has projections called cristae
					3. Intermembrane space and matrix inside
						- More partitions inside the organelle 
			- Multienzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reaction ([[Enzymes]])
			- Products
				1. For each 3 carbon pyruvate molecule, 1 CO2 is created
					1. Decarboxylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase
				2. 1 Acetyl (two carbon) CoA, which consists of 2 carbons from pyruvate attached to coenzyme A, is created
					1. Acetyl-CoA proceeds to the Krebs cycle
				3. 1 NADH is created
					1. All NADH will be used in final fourth stage
				4. Upon entering the mitochondrial matrix, a multi-enzyme complex converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. In the process, CO2 is released and one molecule of NADH is formed
		- Krebs cycle
			- Occurs in the matrix mitochondria
			- Oxidizes the Acetyl group from pyruvate
			- Biochemical pathway of 9 steps in three segments
				1. Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate --> citrate 
					1. Two carbon + four carbon --> 6 carbon molecule
				2. Citrate rearrangement and decarboxylation
					1. Chemically modify 6 carbons and as we go through cycle, a carbon is removed
						- 6 carbons to 5 carbons
						- Generates CO2
					2. Another carbon is removed further in cycle
						- Now a 4 carbon molecule (oxaloacetate)
				1. Regeneration of oxaloacetate
					1. Then another Acetyl group is introduced and cycle repeats
			- The cycle repeats
		- For each Acetyl-CoA entering. . .
			- Release 2 molecules of CO2 (two carbons from Acetyl-CoA)
			- Reduce 3 NAD+ to 3 NADH
			- Reduce 1 FAD (electron carrier) to FADH2
			- Produce 1 ATP
			- Regenerate oxaloacetate
		- At this point, glucose has been oxidized to. . .
			- 6 CO2
			- 4 ATP
			- 10 NADH
			- 2 FADH2
			- Electron transfer has released 53 kcal/mol of energy by gradual [[energy]] extraction
				1. Not enough, but these electron carries proceed to the electron transport chain
	- Electron transport chain and chemiosmosis
		- Main source of [[energy]]
		- Energy used to create large supply of [[ATP]]
		- ETC is a series of membrane-bound electron carriers
			1. A series of [[protein|proteins]] embedded in inner mitochondrial membrane
				1. Quintenary structures
				2. Like little machines
		- Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are transferred to complexes of the ETC
			1. Oxidizes NADH to NAD+
				1. Releases [[energy]]
		- Each complex has a proton pump creating proton gradient
			1. Transfers electrons to next carrier
			2. Requires energy bc active transport against concentration gradient
			3. Three large complex 
			4. 1st pump
				1. Pumps protons from matrix to inner membrane space
				2. Called NADH dehydrogenates
					- Removal of proton from NADH
					- The electrons associated with it are pumped into the 2nd complex
						- To get to 2nd complex, you have organic molecule called quinome
						- Passes the electrons along
			5. 2nd pump
				1. Also a proton pump
				2. Protons cannot diffuse across membrane without help
					- Membrane is like a dam
				3. Takes electrons and passes them to the 3rd complex
					- Via protein called cytochrome c
						- A protein on the inner membrane for passing electrons
			6. 3rd pump
				1. Called cytochrome oxidase
					- Oxidizes cytochrome
				2. Then the two electrons are taken plus oxygen and to make water
					1. Protons are pumped from mitochondrial matrix to intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form H2O
				3. Must hold electrons until it has four electrons
					1. Then it gets oxygen and makes water
					2. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons (wants 2 more) ([[Chemical Bonds]])
						1. Needs two H to get electrons
						2. When getting electrons, there are times when it has 7 (unpaired electron)
							- Called a free radical (very reactive)
							- Do not want to create free radicals, so cytochrome oxidase holds H until there are four so oxygen does not become free radical
			1. [[ATP]] synthase
				1. A complex, molecular [[enzymes|enzyme]] that uses proton (H+) gradient to form ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi)
				2. Protons pumped to the ATP synthase to make ATP
				3. In oxidative phosphorylation, the pH gradient formed by electron transport chain is used by ATP synthase to form ATP
			2. Citric acid cycle
				1. Another name for Krebss cycle
				2. The final product (oxaloacetate) is also the first reactant so the cycle runs continuously in the presence of sufficient reactants and Acetyl CoA
		- Theoretical energy yield
			1. 38 ATP per glucose for bacteria
			2. 36 ATP per glucose for eukaryotes
		- Actual energy yield
			1. 30 ATP per glucose for eukaryotes
			2. Reduced yield is due to 
				1. Leaky inner membrane
				2. Use of proton gradient for purposes other than ATP synthesis

Wool fiber::Cuticle on outside (like overlapping snake scales and barbs) and cortex on inside (spongy material and semi-hollow)
^1664906114609

Felting::The process of weaving fibers together; Uses the cuticle barbs to interlock
^1664906114616

The cortex absorbs --- and is a great ---::dyes easily; insulator (traps warm air)
^1664906114624

Corse wool::Large and rough; Low quality; Big barbs (uncomfortable to wear; itchy); Sometimes used for carpets
^1664906114630

Fine wool::Smaller diameter; Smaller barbs; Used for clothing (smaller barbs = more comfortable)
^1664906114637

Alpaca, cashmere, silk, linen, cotton, and polyester can be used ---::instead of wool; Some are barbed (such as alpaca) and others are smooth (such as silk; harder to interweave)

^1664906114726

[[2022-10-06]]
Brake points::Weakness in fiber due to a past illness; When animal gets sick, nutrients go from growth to fighting illness but wool keeps growing (results in weak break point); Shortens the staple length bc it breaks easily
^1665101999684

Shearing::Removal of the wool; Wool is prime over the winter and starts to shed in the spring (northern hemisphere); We shear in late spring after the typical frost but before lambing (cleaner and prevents lambs from getting tongue stuck in it)
^1665101999692

Shearing is a --- but not an easy job::fast procedure; Shearers start in south and move north as spring creeps upward
^1665101999699

Steps in wool production::Raw wool (Tinted brown w/ lanolin); Wool scouring train; Centrifuge (collects lanolin); Dyed Wool; Set of Cards (makes fibers go in same direction); Spinning frame (wraps fibers together); Loom (creates fabric); Fulling Mill (finishes fabric)
^1665101999705

Fewest sheep in the ---::South (hot + humid; mostly hair); Farm flocks mostly in the Midwest and Northeast; Larger flocks in west w/ mostly wool sheep
^1665101999713

Sheep numbers have dramatically --- in the US::dropped; Both meat and wool; Don't eat as much lamb due to WWII and wrong season (market in July-Aug but lamb is Christmas/Easter holiday food; imported from southern hemisphere (more expensive as well)); Competitors to wool including polyester and nylon (synthetic oil derivatives; less expensive than wool)
^1665101999720

Shepherds::Hard job and lifestyle; Isolation and seclusion; Must constantly move sheep to have enough grass
^1665101999726

Another issue facing sheep is ---::predation; Sheep are small and make easy prey; Most sheep lost to cayotes (about 75% of sheep lost to predation); Predation is 52% cause of death overall
^1665101999733

Contract grazing::Use sheep to graze lawns; Vineyards to eat grass but don't eat grapes; Solar farms to keep grass level down (don't climb on panels like goats)
^1665101999740

Goat diet::Browsing animals; Concentrate selectors; Do not eat everything but prefer wider variety of forages than sheep

Young female goat::doeling
^1665101999791

Young goat::kid
^1665101999798

Goat Reproduction::Seasonal breeders (short day for most); Estrous cycle = 21 days; Estrus = 24 hours; Gestation = 150 days; Puberty = 5-7 months
^1665101999806

Goat life cycle::Day 0 = breeding season (sept-nov); Day 150 = kidding (mar-apr; castration, immunization, and ear tags); Day 200 = weaning (may-june); Day 260 = typical market start (meat; july-aug; wider range than sheep bc flavor not as intense); Day 365 = breeding season (sept-nov; cycle repeats)
^1665101999812

Fiber types::Angora goats produce mohair ("goat's hair fabric"; type of hair); Cashmere (not a breed; the guard hair or undercoat of goats; expensive bc hard to weave as hair)
^1665101999820

Goat products::Goat milk, cheese, oils, meat
^1665101999826

Dairy goats::Nubian (name from GB but ultimately from Africa), La Mancha (spanish but developed in oregon)
^1665101999833

Meat goats::Boer (stocky and large frame; can be bred year-round unlike most goats); Kiko (new zealand); Myotonic (called fainting goats due to physiological defect (when startled, both biceps and triceps lock up))
^1665101999840

There are --- sheep and --- goats in the US::5.2 mil; 2.62 mil; Fewer goats than sheep
^1665101999847

Goats are good for ---::contract graving; Eat wider variety of forage; Can be used when grapes dormant in vineyards (eat weeds) then bring in sheep when grapes appear
^1665101999855

Goats in Argania trees; Argan oil comes from trees, goats eat fruit then oil extracted from feces; Very expensive

Goats can go --- easily::feral; Can lead to overgrazing if feral (ex Galapagos islands project)
^1665101999862

A grazing animal tends to prefer more limited types of forages, predominantly the grasses. Browsing animals have preferences for a ---::wide variety of forages that may also include fruits and seeds.

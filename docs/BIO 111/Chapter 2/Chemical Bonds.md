I. [[The Nature of Atoms]]
	A. Molecules are groups of atoms held together in stable associations
	B. Compounds are molecules containing more than one type of [[Element]] 
	C. 3 Types of chemical bonds
		- Ionic bonds = Formed by attraction of oppositely charged ions
			a. Gain or loss of [[electrons]] forms ions
				i. Na atom loses an electron to become Na+
				ii. Cl atom gains an electron to become CL-
				iii. Opposite charges attract so that Na+ and Cl- remain associated as an ionic compound
			b. Electrical attraction of [[Water]] molecules can disrupt forces holding ions together
		- Covalent bonds = form when atoms share 2 or more valence [[Electrons]]
			a. Results in no net charge
			b. Satisfies octet rule with no unpaired electrons
			c. Strength of covalent bond depends on the number of shared electrons
			d. Many biological compounds are composed of more than 2 atoms
				i. May share electrons with 2 or more atoms
			e. Single covalent bond
				i. Hydrogen gas (H2)
					~ H - H
					~ Sharing two [[Electrons]]
			f. Double covalent bond
				i. Oxygen gas (O2)
					~ O = O
					~ Sharing four electrons
			g. Triple covalent bond
				i. Nitrogen gas (N2)
					~ N=-N
					~ Sharing six electrons
			h. Distribution around orbitals of [[Atoms]] not always equal
				i. If sharing is completely equal, then it is a nonpolar covalent bond
				ii. If sharing is unequal, then it is a polar covalent bond
				iii. Both [[Water]] and carbon dioxide have polar covalent bonds, but carbon dioxide is linear, so the partial charges on the molecule cancel each other out and it is nonpolar overall
					~ O - C - O (nonpolar molecule)
					~ Water is in bent shape because of two negative H (polar molecule)
					~ Methane has four H and one C. Four H are all positively charged and are equidistance around C, making it a nonpolar molecule. No unequal distribution.
		- Hydrogen bond
			a. Individually very weak and transitory
				i. Collectively they can be very strong
			b. Cohesion = polarity of [[Water]] allows water molecules to be attracted to one another
				i. Net positive charge of H attracted to net negative charge of O
			c. Attraction produces hydrogen bonds
			d. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for many of [[Water]]'s physical properties

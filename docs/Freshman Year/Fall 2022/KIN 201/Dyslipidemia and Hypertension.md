1. Cardio disease risk factors
	- Cholesterol builds up in walls of arteries and forms plaque
	- Plaque ruptures, often due to increased blood pressure in that artery
		1. This causes blood to clot in the artery and block blood flow
	- High cholesterol = dyslipidemia
	- High blood pressure = hypertension
	- 1.5 mil Americans have heart attacks each year, w/ an annual cost of 320 bil from medical expenses and lost work productivity
	- Unmodifiable risk factors
		1. Sex
			- Males have higher risk than females
		2. Age 
		3. Family history
		4. Race
	- Modifiable risk factors
		1. Physical inactivity
		2. Diet
		3. Obesity
		4. Diabetes
		5. Smoking
		6. Dyslipidemia
		7. Hypertension
2. Dyslipidemia
	- Blood lipids (fats)
		1. Cholesterol is needed for cellular structures and hormone production
		2. Triglycerides serve as source of energy used in cells, part of cellular structures
		3. Fats are not soluble in water (don't dissolve), so they don't travel very well in the blood without something to carry them
			- Lipoproteins are transport proteins
	- Lipoproteins
		1. Chylomicrons
			- Associated w/ increased risk of CVD
		2. VLDL - very low-density lipoprotein
			- Somewhat associated w/ increased risk of CVD
		3. LDL - low-density lipoprotein
			- Strongly associated w/ increased risk
			- Carries cholesterol to tissues in body (deposits cholesterol)
			- Rec level is < 130 mg/dL
		4. HDL - high density lipoprotein
			- Associated w/ decreased risk
			- Transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver (removes cholesterol)
			- Blocks/inhibits progression from LDL-C deposit to plaque formation
			- Rec level is > 40 mg/dL
		5. Total cholesterol rec is < 200 mg/dL
			- More than 102 mil Americans have TC above 200 mg/dL
3. Hypertension
	- Blood pressure is divided into 2 components
		1. Systolic = pressure while heart is contracting
		2. Diastolic = pressure while heart is relaxing (in between beats)
	- For ex: 120 mmHG (systolic) / 80 mmHg (diastolic)
	- Blood pressure is directly related to risk of heart attacks and strokes
		1. Risk increases once blood pressure increases above 115 / 75
			- Risk doubles w/ every 20 mmHg is systolic BP above 115 and every 10 mmHg in diastolic BP above 75
		2. Greater risk from increases in diastolic blood pressure due to extra strain placed on the heart
	- American Heart Association classifications
		1. Elevated = 120-129 systolic
		2. Stage 1 hypertension is 130-139 for systolic and 80-89 diastolic
		3. Stage 2 hypertension is >140 and >90
		4. Approx 46% of Americans have hypertension
	- Unmodifiable
		1. Age
		2. Family history
	- Modifiable
		1. Stress
		2. Physical activity
		3. Body weight
		4. Diet
			- Limit sat fat intake ("Mediterranean diet")
				1. Decreases body fat
				2. Decreases blood lipoproteins, specifically LDL
				3. Reduces production of cholesterol 
			- Limit sodium intake (DASH diet)
				1. Less than 2300 mg of sodium per day, and less than 1500 mg if you have higher risk of hypertension
				2. Reduction in processed food, high sodium condiments, and frozen foods
4. Diabetes
	- Control of blood glucose
		1. Insulin is used to move glucose (sugar) from the blood stream into the tissues, where it's used for energy or stored
			- After you eat, blood glucose goes up, then insulin brings it back down
		2. Proper control = euglycemia
	- In diabetes, insulin doesn't work effectively (for different reasons at different stages of the disease), so blood glucose cannot be effectively controlled
	- High blood glucose = hyperglycemia
	- Diagnosed when blood sugar levels remain above 126 mg/dL
	- Type 1 diabetes (~ 3 mil Americans)
		1. Pancreas is not capable of producing insulin
			- Autoimmune disease = immune system destroys the beta-cells in the pancreas
		2. Requires insulin to be taken to manage blood glucose
	- Type 2 diabetes (~26 mil Americans)
		1. Tissues become insensitive or resistant to insulin
			- NIDDM = non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
		2. Body is producing insulin, but it's not responding to it anymore
			- As the disease progresses, eventually the body stops producing enough insulin as well
	- Complications
		1. Macrovascular disease
			- Heart attacks and strokes
			- Leading cause of death in people w/ diabetes
		2. Microvascular disease
			- Damage to eyes, kidneys, and nerves
	- Pre-diabetes
		1. People w/ blood sugar concentrations greater than 100 mg/dL are classified as "pre-diabetic"
		2. Over 86 mil Americans
		3. Non modifiable risk factors 
			- Age 
			- Family history
			- Ethnicity
		4. Modifiable risk factors
			- Overweight/obesity
			- Reduces body weight
			- Improves blood pressure
			- Increases HDL
			- Lowers triglycerides
		5. How can nutritional choices affect pre-diabetes?
			- Glycemic load: how does a food affect blood sugar levels?
				1. Based on both total cars in food and how rapidly the food increases blood glucose (glycemic index)
				2. Proper nutrition is critical for body comp management
				3. Influences HDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure

Photosynthesis (biol)::light dependent reaction + light independent reaction; To synthesize energy from light
^1665610860895

Light dependent reaction::Light --> charged energy; Pigments absorb sunlight energy and use water to obtain electrons; O2 is by product from the splitting of water
^1665610850615

Energy "capture" is preformed by ---::autotrophs only; Plants and algae; CO2 --> Glucose (C4H12O6)
^1665610850627

Light independent reaction::Charged energy --> energy that can be used for plants cells; Carbon fixation from the carbon cycle
^1665610850634

Photosynthesis equation is the opposite of ---::aerobic respiration; Products are reactants and vise versa; All living things do aerobic respiration but only autotrophs do photosynthesis
^1665610850640

Carbon cycle::Plants take our waste (CO2) and we eat plants (or other things that eat plants) to get glucose (w/ carbons) for energy
^1665610850646

How does sunlight energy capture occur?::Photosynthetic pigments in plants; Chloroplasts
^1665610850652

Sunlight is made up of a ---::spectrum of wavelengths; White sunlight has range of wavelengths from about 400-800 nm; Visible spectrum; Pigments absorb different wavelengths 
^1665610850658

How can we measure photosynthesis?::The release of oxygen (O2); If we remove sunlight, photosynthesis doesn't occur; In the presence of sunlight, plants should produce glucose and oxygen
^1665610850664

We observed the production of oxygen by putting ---::plants underwater in the sunlight and comparing the O2 bubbles in water they produced to the lack of O2 bubbles in plants in the dark
^1665610850673

We observed the use of CO2 in photosynthesis by ---::putting a plant in a solution that lightens in presence of   CO2; After we initially breathed CO2 into the solution, the plants darkened the solution by using up the CO2 in the presence of sunlight; No change in color in plants in darkness
^1665610850680

We observed the presence of pigments by ---::boiling the pigment in a leaf out then bathing the leaf in IKI solution; Where there was previously pigment, the IKI solution turned blue-black (pigment is complex carb)
^1665610850686

We scraped pigment from a spinach leaf onto chromatography paper. Then we submerged the paper into a developing solvent. As the solvent diffused throughout the paper, it carried the ---::heaviest pigments the shortest distance and the lightest pigments the farthest distance
^1665610850692

Pigments in spinach leaf from heaviest to lightest::Chlorophyll b (green), Chlorophyll a (blue-green), Xanthophyll (yellow-brown), Carotene (yellow)

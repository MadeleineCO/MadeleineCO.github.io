1. DNA History ([[History of Genetics]])
	1. Friedrich Miescher
		1. Coined the word "nuclein" for nucleic acid
		2. Isolated phosphate-rich chemicals from nuclei of white blood cells in 1868
	2. Debates about if DNA is hereditary material
		1. 1928: Frederick Griffith experimented w/ smooth (S), a virulent strain of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and rough (R) nonvirulent strain
			1. Bacterial transformation demonstrates transfer genetic material
			2. Took S strain and injected in mouse - mouse died
				1. S is virulent
			3. Took R strain and injected in mouse - mouse lived
				1. R is nonvirulent
			4. Took S strain and killed it by applying heat then injected in mouse - mouse lived
			5. Took heat-killed S strain and mixed it w/ R strain - mouse died
				1. Living S was recovered from the mouse after analyzing tissue
				2. The R strain was transformed to S strain
				3. Didn't know exactly what caused transformation at the time
		2. 1943: Oswald Avery, Colin Macleod, and Maclyn McCarty took DNA from a virulent S strain from bacterium, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and rough (R) nonvirulent strain
			1. Many thought the hereditary material was protein
			2. Determined that DNA was the transformation material
				1. Took living R form, heat-killed S components, and purified transforming principle
				2. Protease -> protein destroyed -> introduced into R cells -> S cells (transformation)
				3. RNase -> RNA destroyed -> introduced into R cells -> S cells (transformation)
				4. Dnase -> DNA destroyed -> introduced into R cells -> R cells (*no transformation*)
				5. Ultracentrifugation -> fats eliminated -> introduced into R cells -> S cells (transformation)
				6. Physical and chemical analysis -> indicated predominance of DNA
		3. 1952: Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase provided convincing evidence that DNA is genetic material
			1. Waring blender experiment using T2 bacteriophage and bacteria
				1. Bacteriophage = virus that takes over genome of bacteria
					1. Phage attaches to bacterium (host) -> Phage injects its genes into host cell -> Phage DNA replicates, new phage proteins are made -> Phage particles assemble -> cell bursts releasing new phage
					2. T2 phages are only made up of proteins and nucleic acids
						1. Protein shell around DNA
						2. Empty shell is called protein ghost after DNA is injected into host cell
				2. Used radioactive labels 32P for DNA and 35S for protein (isotopes)
					1. *Infection -> Blending to shake off protein shells -> Centrifugation (heavy bacteria condensed and viral protein shells suspended)*
					2. T2 phage -> Infect E. coli and grow in 32P-containing medium -> Phages w/ 32P-labeled DNA -> Introduce phages into bacteria culture -> Radioactivity recovered in host and passed on to phage progeny
					3. T2 phage -> Infect E. coli and grow in 35S-containing medium -> Phages w/ 35S-labeled protein -> Introduce phages into bacteria culture -> Radioactivity recovered in phage ghosts
	3. The Watson-Crick Model: DNA is a double helix
		1. 1951: James Watson learns about x-ray diffraction pattern projected by DNA
			1. Rosalind Franklin photographed molecules using x-rays 
				1. Patterns indicated DNA was like a coil
				2. Constant diameter of 2 nm
				3. Kings College in London
				4. Her colleague was Maurice Wilkins
		2. Knowledge of the chemical structure of nucleotides (deoxyribose sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base) allowed Watson and Crick to model DNA in 1953
2. DNA Overview
	1. DNA (replication) -> RNA (transcription and translation) -> protein synthesis (amino acids)
	2. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)
	3. The blueprint for life
	4. Gene = a section of DNA that codes for a protein
	5. Found in the nucleus 
		1. RNA copy leaves the nucleus to go to the ribosome
	6. 46 human chromosomes
		2. 60 in cattle
		3. 54 in sheep 
		4. 60 in goats
		5. 78 in dogs
		6. 38 in cats
		7. 78 in chickens
		8. 38 in pigs
		9. 80 in turkeys
		10. 64 in horses
		11. 62 in donkeys
			1. Donkey + horse = mule w/ 63
		12. 74 in camels
		13. 74 in alpacas
		14. 74 in llamas
		15. 44 in rabbits
		16. 42 in rats
		17. 40 in mice
	7. Karyotype = layout of all the chromosomes
		1. In humans, 1-22 are autosomal and X/Y are sex chromosomes
			1. X is bigger than the Y
				1. X has many more genes
	8. A-T is a *double* bond
		1. C-G is a *triple* bond (stronger)
		2. DNA double strand can separate into 2 single strands when heated
			1. C-G requires more heat to break
	9. Some DNA molecules are circular instead of linear
		1. Specifically Prokaryotes, Mitochondria, Chloroplasts, and Viruses
		2. Some viruses carry single-stranded DNA (ex bacteriophages) while others carry RNA (ex AIDS)
	11. Four requirements for DNA to be genetic material
		1. Must carry info
			1. Cracking the genetic code
		2. Must replicate
		3. Must allow for info to change
			1. Mutation
		4. Must govern the expression of the phenotype
			1. Gene function 
3. DNA Structure
	1. DNA is a polymer of nucleotides
	2. Each nucleotide is composed of. . .
		1. Nitrogen base
		2. Phosphate
		3. Five Carbon Sugar
	3. Four kinds of nitrogenous bases
		1. Purines are adenine (A) and guanine (G)
		2. Pyrimidines are cytosine (C) and thymine (T)
		3. adenine pairs w/ thymine and guanine pairs w/ cytosine
			1. AT and GC
	4. DNA is a double helix
		1. Discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953
4. DNA Replication
	1. Occurs in the nucleus
	2. Each DNA strand becomes a template as the parent strand comes apart
		1. Proper base-pairs are assembled on that template
	3. DNA Helicase is the enzyme that unwinds the double helix by breaking the H bonds between the complementary bases
	4. DNA polymerase is the main agent of replication as it synthesizes complementary strands to the templates
		1. Runs 5' -> 3'
	5. Nucleotides are connected together to make a new strand that is complementary to the old strand
		1. The new double strand is duplicate to the old double strand
		2. This is called semiconservative replication
			1. New DNA each has one old and one new strand
			2. Double helix unwinds
			3. Each strand acts as template
			4. Complementary base pairing ensures that T signals addition of A on new strand, and G signals addition of C
			5. Two daughter helixes produced after replication
	6. The Steps of DNA Replication
		1. DNA replication begins at the *origin of replication*
			1. Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication
			2. Prokaryotes only have one origin of replication
				1. And circular chromosomes
		2. Original double helix strands are separated by *helicase*
			1. Creates replication fork
			2. Unwinds double helix
		3. *Single stranded binding proteins* prevent the separated strands from annealing
			1. Keeps separated strands separate 
		4. *Primase* creates primer, which tells the DNA polymerase where to begin replicating
		5. *DNA polymerase III*  begins creating the complementary strand from 5'-3'
			1. Leading strand is synthesized continuously 
				1. Leading strand runs 3' to 5' and new complementary strand runs 5' to 3'
			2. Lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously
				1. Lagging strand runs 5' to 3' and new complementary strand runs 3' to 5'
				2. Made in chunks called Okazaki fragments
				3. *Ligase* welds the Okazaki fragments together
		6. *DNA polymerase I* fills in gaps between newly synthesized Okazaki segments

	7. Replication is bidirectional
		1. Replication forks move in opposite directions
		2. In linear chromosomes, *telomeres* ensure the maintenance and accurate replication of chromosome ends
		3. In circular chromosomes, such as *E. coli*, there is only one origin of replication
			1. Unwinding and replication causes supercoiling in circular chromosomes, which may impede replication
			2. *Topoisomerase* is an enzyme that relaxes supercoils by nicking strands
1. Cells must ensure accuracy of genetic info
	1. Redundancy is the basis for repair of errors that occur during replication or during storage
	2. Enzymes repair chemical damage to DNA
	3. Errors during replication are rare
2. Double stranded break model of meiotic recombination
	1. Homologs physically break, exchange parts, and rejoin
		1. Breakage and repair create reciprocal products of recombination
		2. Recombination events can occur anywhere along the DNA molecule
	2. Precision in the exchange prevents mutations from occurring during the process
	3. Gene conversion can give rise to unequal yield of two different alleles 
		1. 50% of gene conversions are associated w/ crossing over of adjacent chromosomal regions
		2. 50% of gene conversions are not associated w/ crossing over
3. Essential Concepts
	1. DNA is the nearly universal genetic material.
	2. The Watson-Crick model shows that DNA is a double helix composed of two antiparallel strands of nucleotides:  each nucleotide consists of one of four nitrogenous bases (A,T,C, or G), a deoxyribose sugar, and a phosphate.  An A pairs with a T and a G pairs with a C.
	3. DNA carries information in the sequence of its bases, which may follow one another in any order.

1. Overview
	- Communication between [[Cell|cells]] requires two critical components (signal + receiver)
		1. Ligand – signaling molecule
			- Many different types
				1. Could be a [[Protein]], small molecule, gas, physical connection, etc.
		1. Receptor [[Protein]] – molecule to which the receptor binds
		2. Interaction of these two components initiates the process of signal transduction, which converts the information in the signal into a cellular response
2. Four basic mechanisms for cellular communication
	- Direct contact
		1. "Receive the squeeze"
		2. Rapid (instantaneous) but localized
	- Paracrine signaling
		1. Nearby [[Cell|cells]]
		2. Ligand and receptor not touching
			- Ligand is released then binds to the receptor
		3. Can be moderately quick
		4. Paracrine response to cat bite causing inflammation
			- Inflammation is one type of paracrine signaling
	- Endocrine signaling
		1. Ligands travel long distances to get to receptors
		2. Relatively slow but long-lasting and powerful
		3. Sex hormones
	- [[Synaptic Signaling]]
		1. Don't touch, but precise distance between where ligands are released and receptors
		2. Very fast (almost instant) and can span great distances 
			- Travels very quickly for the distances involved
			- Pain receptors in fingers zip a signal from brain and from brain to fingers, but response is almost instant because of speed
	- Some [[Cell|cells]] send signals to themselves (autocrine signaling)
		1. Sorta a fifth type, but could be seen as version of paracrine
3. Signal transduction 
	- Events within [[Cell]] that occur in response to a signal
	- When a ligand binds to a receptor [[protein]], the [[cell]] has a response
	- Different [[cell]] types can respond differently to the same signal
		1. Ex: Epinephrine and adrenaline 
			- Molecules like this make bodies do a number of things
		2. Can bind to different receptors 
			- One signal could cause some muscles to contract and others to relax
			- Causes challenges for pharmaceutical industry
				1. Side effects 
				2. Drugs are ligands that can bind to other receptors, causing unwanted side effects
	- To smell, chemicals in the air bind to respecters inside our nose. Stimulates conversion to electrical signal
		1. Same thing w/ taste
			- Sweet receptors on tip of tongue, salty on sides, etc.
	- The ideal drug only binds to one targeted receptor, but not as simple in reality
	- Signals are only as good as the receptors 
4. Chemical Signaling Overview
	- Autocrine ([[cell]] targets itself)
	- Signaling across gap junctions ([[cell]] targets cell connected by gap junctions)
		1. Quick
	- Paracrine ([[cell]] targets nearby cell)
		1. Usually inflammation in local area
		2. Quick
	- Endocrine ([[cell]] targets distant cell through the bloodstream)
		1. Small in concentration
		2. Travel great distances
		3. Slow
		4. Long lasting effects
		5. Ex: Hormones 
	- Speed and distance are fundamental concepts for examining signaling
	- [[Synaptic Signaling]]
5. [[Receptor Types]]

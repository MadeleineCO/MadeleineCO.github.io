I. Hydrophobic
	A. The fur of aquatic mammals protect them from [[Water]] (water proofing)
	B. Fats are non-polar
		- Like dissolves like, so fats dissolve in other fats, NOT [[Water]]
II. Structure
	A. Whenever you have a long chain of [[Hydrocarbon]] (H + C), the hydrocarbon tail is non-polar
		- One end of chain has hydroxyn group (HO)
			a. Allows fatty acids to bond at that point
			b. Triacylglycerol is formed by joining of three fatty acids to glycerol backbone in dehydration reaction
				i. Triglyceride and fatty acids main components of lipids
				i. Three [[Water]] molecules released in process
				ii. Linked to the carbons in the glycerol
					~ Creates a triglyceride
	B. If a fatty acid has nothing but single bonds, it is a *saturated* fat
		- Stearic acid
			a. A common saturated fatty acid that is composed of 18 carbon chain
		- Not bent
			a. Stackable
			b. A trans fat
		- Lard is solid at room temperature because it is stackable
			a. This is why solid fats are unhealthy and clog arteries
	C. If a fatty acid has a double bond, it is a *unsaturated* fat
		- Bent shape
			a. a cis fat
		- Liquid at room temp
			a. Considered healthy and cannot clog arteries
		- Alpha-linolenic acid is an omega-3 fat
			a. Has three cis double bonds and curved shape
			b. Very unstackable so very healthy
			c. Each singly bonded carbon has two hydrogens associated with it
	D. Wax coverings are made of lipids
		- Ex: magnolia leaves have wax covering so it repels [[Water]]
III. Phospholipid
	A. Three carbon molecule with three [[Hydrocarbon]] chains
	B. Has charged phosphate group
	C. Portions that are hydrophobic but another portion that is hydrophilic
		- Hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail
	D. Creates membranes
		- The barriers of [[Cell]]s
		- Hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head group
			a. Tails congregate and heads congregrate
				i. Tails end up in middle and heads on outside
IV. Steroids
	A. Cholesterol and cortisol are composed of four fused [[Hydrocarbon]] rings
		- Cortisol is made from cholesterol
			a. Stress hormone
	B. Sex hormones
		- Testosterone and estrogen
		- Made starting with cholesterol
	C. Have basic four ring structure
		- Different functional groups surrounding rings

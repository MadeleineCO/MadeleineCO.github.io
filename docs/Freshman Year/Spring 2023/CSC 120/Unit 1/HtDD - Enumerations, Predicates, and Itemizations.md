1. An *enumeration* specifies distinct, individual elements from an existing class of data 
	1. Ex: ;;A LetterGrade consists of:
			;;- "A"
			;;- "B"
			;;- "C"
	1. Don't list all data for things like key-events bc so extensive
2. Predicates
	1. Refers to functions that return true/false
		1. A boolean value
	2. Predicates are used to distinguish the classes of data that we know so far
		1. String?
		2. Image?
		3. Boolean?
		4. Number?
		5. Negative?
		6. Positive?
		7. Odd?
		8. Even?
3.  An *itemization* generalizes intervals and enumerations
	1. Used when info consists of two or more subcategories, at least one of which is not a distinct data item
	2. Interval = a data definition that distinguishes different subclasses or ranges of numbers
	3. Enumeration = a data definition that specifies distinct individual elements from some existing class of data (ex strings)
	4. Itemization = a data definition that allows us to combine existing types of data
		1. AKA mixed data
		2. Often uses comparison, equality operators, or type predicates in the function

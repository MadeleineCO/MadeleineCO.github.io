1. Shared Deuterostome traits
	1. Bilateral, triploblastic
	2. Organ systems
		1. CDS
		2. CCS
		3. Better osmoregulation
		4. Nervous system development increases 
	3. Segmentation is present
		1. Vertebrae
		2. Muscles 
	4. Eucoelomates
2. Chordate synapomorphies
	1. Notochord
		1. Band of tissue that travels from tail to the head
		2. Site of muscle attachment
		3. Eventually developed into vertebral column 
			1. Center of the column
	2. Dorsal hollow nerve chord
		1. Aligned on top of the notochord
		2. Vertebral column forms around it to protect the nerve chord
			1. As compared to ventral nerve chord in some invertebrates
	3. Pharyngeal slits
		1. Not seen in human adults but seen during embryonic development
	4. Post-anal tail
		1. Seen in humans during embryonic development
	5. Endostyle
		1. Develops into our thyroid glands
	6. All Chordates show these at some point
3. Subphylum Cephalochordata
	1. The lancelets
		1. Name = "head chordates"
		2. Notochord into head
		3. Invertebrate chordate
	2. Distinguishing traits
		1. Poorly defined brain
		2. NS in dor-hol-ner-tub
		3. Gas exchange over body
	3. Ecology and Reproduction
		1. Small filter feeders
		2. Marine benthic
		3. Dioecious
		4. External fertilization 
			1. Release gametes into water
4. Subphylum Urochordata
	1. The tunicates
		1. Name = "tail chordates"
		2. Tunic (cellulose)
			1. Provides structural rigidity
		3. Notochord into tail
		4. Invertebrate chordate
	2. Distinguishing traits
		1. Tadpole larva
			1. Shows all chordate traits
			2. Mobile
		2. Adults
			1. Only show pharyngeal slits and endostyle
			2. Sessile for the most part
	3. Ecology and Repro
		1. Small filter feeders
		2. Marine sessile/motile
		3. Solitary or colonial
			1. Ex: salp is a colonial 
		4. Monoecious
		5. Internal hatching
			1. Motile larvae 
		6. Component of soft-body reefs
			1. Too cool for corals 
			2. Sponges also seen in these
5. Subphylum Vertebrata
	1. The vertebrates
		1. AKA Craniate
		2. About 62,000 spp

		2. Vertebrate column
	3. Major "clades"
		1. Agnatha 
			1. Jawless fishes
		2. Gnathostomes
			1. Jawed vertebrates
		3. Osteichthyes
			1. Bony vertebrates
		4. Tetrapods

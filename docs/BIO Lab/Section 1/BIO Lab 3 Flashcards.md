Cell Theory::Every organism is made up of at least one cell; Cell is the basic unit of life; Produced by division of pre-existing cells
^1662573182884

Prokaryotic Cells::Lack membrane-bound organelle; Relatively simple interior structure; Region of DNA (nucleoid) instead of nucleus DNA; Small ribosomes
^1662573182895

Prokaryotic cells reproduce by --- and are ---::fission;1-10 microns in diameter (A micron is 1 millionth of a meter)
^1662573182902

Types of prokaryotic organisms::bacteria, archaea, cyanobacteria
^1662573182908

Bacteria shapes::Coccus (round/spherical), Bacillus (rod-shaped), Spirillum (corkscrew/spiral)
^1662573182914

Archaea (biol)::Found in extreme environments; thermophiles (very hot) and halophiles (very salty)
^1662573196113

Cyanobacteria::blue-green algae; Oscillatoria and Anabaena; Can photosynthesize; provide oxygen
^1662573182922

Eukaryotic Cells::Cytomembrane (endomembrane) system and membrane bound organelles; Relatively complex interior structure; DNA in nucleus and chromatin (individual chromosomes); Large ribosomes
^1662573182928

Eukaryotic cells reproduce by --- and are ---::mitosis and meiosis; larger than prokaryotic cells (10-1000 microns in diameter)
^1662573182934

Types of eukaryotic cells::Protists, Fungi, Plants, Animals
^1662573182939

Protists::Single celled organisms; Ex: Paramecium, Amoeba, Euglena, Volvox, Physarum, Slime mold
^1662573182945

Fungi example::yeast
^1662573182951

Plants have cell walls made up of ---::cellulose; ex: elodea
^1662573183113

Animal example::human cheek cells

Ocular lenses::lenses you look through in a microscope
^1662661298002

Carry microscope by the curved ---::carrying handle
^1662661298014

Objective lens::4x (scanning), 10x (low), 40x (high dry), 100x (oil immersion; we did not use 100x)
^1662661298020

Total magnification = ocular x objective (10x (ocular) x 4, 10, 40, or 100x (objective))

In lab, the highest level of magnification that we can attain is 400x (ie we do not use 100x objective, highest is 10x x 40x)

Slide holder::holds the slide in place on the stage
^1662661298026

Light::Comes from beneath the stage; has light intensity control on the side
^1662661298032

Coarse adjustment::the large, inner wheel for focusing
^1662661298039

Fine adjustment::the smaller, outer wheel for focusing
^1662661298047

Has two knobs for moving the ---::stage; up-down and left-right
^1662661298056

Controlling the light::light source (white light bulb), light intensity switch, Iris diaphragm/condenser aperture, condenser
^1662661298064

Parfocal::The lens stays in focus when magnification/focal length is changed
^1662661298073

Images move in the --- and they are --- when viewed under the compound microscope::opposite direction; upside down
^1662661298080

Only use --- focus under high dry and immersion::fine
^1662661298087

Only use designated --- when cleaning a microscope lens::lens paper
^1662661298093

The micron (u) is generally used to measure ---::sizes in microscopy (1/1,000,000 of a meter)
^1662661298100

Resolution::the ability to distinguish between 2 objects. As resolution increases, the shortest observable distance between objects decreases.
^1662661298106

As you increase the --- of the lens, your --- gets smaller::power; field of view
^1662661298112

We had the option to look at ---::plants (saw plant cells), human cheek cells, prokaryotes such as mixed bacteria (saw coccus, bacillus, and spirillum shapes), cyanobacteria (algae), and protists (amoeba, volvox, slime mold)

1. Cardiovascular disease events
	- Cholesterol builds up in walls of arteries and forms plaque (which stiffens arteries)
	- Plaque ruptures, causing blood to clot in artery and block blood flow
	- While the buildup of cholesterol and plaque is gradual, the rupture and clot happen very quickly
		1. Bypass surgeries and stents don't eliminate future heart attacks, they just fix one problem area
	- Risk factors for CDV events
		1. Low CRF
			- Cardiovascular health is most important factor for preventing CDV events
		2. Obesity
		3. Smoker
		4. Smoker
		5. Hypertension
			- Related to cardio health
		6. High cholesterol
		7. Diabetes
		8. Graph arranged based of vo2 max number from least fit (1) to most fit (5)
			- 1 = <21
			- 2 = 21-28
			- 3 = 28-35
			- 4 = 35-45
			- 5 = >45
		9. As soon as you become physically active, risk of stroke and heart disease drops immediately 
			- Levels off eventually
			- Weekly minimum meets at drop off
		10. Tobacco use increases risk by 2-4x
		11. Dyslipidemia
			- Total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL
			- LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dL
			- HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL
		12. Hypertension is any increase above 120/80
		13. Diabetes
			- 65% of diabetics die of cardiovascular disease
		14. Physicals activity and healthier nutritional choices can alter and manage CVD risk factors 
			- Aerobic training improves cardiovascular function and cholesterol levels, reduces blood pressure and resting HR and insulin resistance 
				1. Overall increase in life expectancy
			- Resistance training reduces hypertension and heart strain, improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, helps manage diabetes, and increases basal metabolic rate
			- Nutritional factors 
				1. Lower fat, fewer refined carbs, more fruits and veggies
				2. Reduces cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes risk, and prevalence of obesity
				3. Focus on whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats, fruits, veggies
		15. Aspirin
			- Prevents blood clotting and reduces occlusion of arteries
			- Reduces damage during a CDV event
			- 25% reduction in future CVD events in people w/ prior history of CDV events
		16. Statins
			- Prevents production of cholesterol in the liver
			- Can greatly improve cholesterol levels, but can severely damage muscles and liver
		17. Beta-blockers
			- Blocks receptors in the heart that stimulate increase in blood pressure and heart rate
		18. ACE inhibitors
			- Inhibits the ACE enzyme, which typically is involved in increasing blood pressure and retaining salt

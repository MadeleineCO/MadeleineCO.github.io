1. Uses inorganic molecules (other than O2) as final electron acceptor
	- Many prokaryotes use sulfur, nitrate, carbon dioxide as alternatives
2. Methanogens
	- CO2 is reduced to CH4 (methane)
		1. Convert carbon dioxide into methane gas
		2. More [[energy]] in methane than carbon dioxide
	- Found in diverse organisms including cows
3. Sulfur bacteria
	- Sulfates that are reduced are called sulfides
		1. Inorganic sulfate (SO4) is reduced to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
	- Early sulfate reducers set the stage for evolution of photosynthesis
	- Green color seen in coastal waters is from eruption of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria
		1. These anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria release hydrogen sulfide gas as they decompose algae in [[water]]
4. [[Cellular Respiration]]
